<p>A couch. It had to be the couch. The bastard scurries away, unheeding in the warnings of the past weeks. Undeterred in his quest for one thing. One, insatiable goal.</p>
<p>To build a nest, in my "Effing" couch.</p>

<p>I'm talking of course about the hilariously painful reality of a 🐿️chipmunk🐿️ sneaking into a hole in my garage after being trapped there, working his way between pipes or God only knows where, and then taking up residence for a two weeks while we were away.</p>
<p>In the process, my couch being the real victim (he's in a better place now, out in pieces on the lawn someone asked if they could take it to their camp so... he's resting)</p>
