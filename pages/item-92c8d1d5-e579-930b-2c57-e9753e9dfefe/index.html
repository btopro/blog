<p class="highlight">*This talk was originally posted on elmsln.org. I've removed it there and moved it here because even though it's about Drupal / ELMSLN, it's the first talk I gave that I started speaking my mind and talking about the bit-coin-ization of the world and structures that aren't sustainable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How can projects like ELMSLN improve the public sector and help transform our interactions with institutions? How can we bring about more collaboration that is peer to peer and institution to institution? These are some of the concepts that ELMSLN lead developer @btopro wrestles with daily.  Watch this rebroadcast of his DrupalCamp Wisconsin (2014) message to kickstart the day.</p>
