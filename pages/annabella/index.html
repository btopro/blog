<p>The wheels squeaked on the cart, jerking it away from the rest of them to get out to put my kid sister in. The exact age I'm unaware, but I remember being fourteen or fifteen. Walking into the grocery store in Scranton, PA, it was like any other day of my youth.</p>
<p>Oldest of three, my youngest sister is ten years (almost to the day) younger than me. In millennial terms we are effectively different generations.</p>
<p>There, pushing her in the cart that day, she used a phrase that I'll never forget; as evidenced by such a specific memory around a phrase.</p>
<p>As I pushed my sister through the produce isle me and her were being silly, the way we always were growing up. My mom walked away to get something and a mother and daughter walked up and commented politely..</p>

<p>Before I could say no, my sister started yelling "Daddy, Daddy!". I remember giving her a look and we went on about our day, telling my parents who also thought she was being funny. Even at 5, trolling me.</p>
<p>I remember that moment as the first time I knew I wanted to be a dad. That <b>title</b>

, that <b>responsibility</b>

, was from that moment on that it held so much weight to me. It seemed a bit heavy, even for that time, to want that responsibility.</p>
<p>I mean, I was the oldest in my family and oldest grandchild, only boy on both sides for a very long time, I was used to helping corral everyone or not having anyone into the same things as me.</p>
<p>Even before my first was born I remember saying to myself I can fail at anything, I can lose it all and be terrible at my job or anything... but not being a parent. Being their dad is, and always has been, something I've taken with the utmost seriousness. They are what I've wanted, these moments I get to live in, are those I sought all the way back then.</p>
<p>I remember how close we were growing up with that gap, that caretaker, trolling about being Dad relationship. I remember dating my "high school sweetheart" (we still say hi once a year and play catch up) and how my little sister got attached to her.</p>
<p>Children imprint on many people around that age (this would have been six or seven). I remember her asking if she could come over to play, or if she could take her to the park. It was like she gained a friend too. I remember us discussing at the time how important this relationship was... referencing her and my sister.</p>
<p>It was around this time I really got into Everclear (the band) and they were on the radio all the time. I got their CD called Learning How to Smile and just eating the songs up. But one in particular, would just slice through me.</p>

<p>It's called Annabella's Song. It's why my wife says she's glad we don't have girls. Because of how I get around babies, how I fall back into that "Daddy" in the grocery store mode. Well, it's because of this song.</p>
<p>I remember going on walks around my neighborhood when I needed to think late at night in college (home on break or summer). I didn't have a great college experience.. but it was really evidenced in how crushed I was to not get to see my little kid, my kid sister when I went off to school.</p>
<p>I cried, A lot when I went to school. It was hard to move from a bubble to the "real world" (which is also a massive bubble, wow was I sheltered..).</p>
<p>Anyway, I remember staring up at the moon, heart broken at the time because of a failed relationship.. and playing this song as loud as I could and just crying the whole walk. I couldn't stop listening to it. The idea that I was away from my kid, that I was growing up, and that she would be hurt (which she wasn't) by my girlfriend and I breaking up...</p>
<p>I see now how insane it all sounds. The rationalizing of a child about what's important, what will impact others..</p>
<p>I only pieced these things back together because that initial phrase came up from a little girl.. a rambunctious, awesome, adorable, funny three year old who just "To hold you up above the world".</p>
<p>Who knew. With all my walls, my locks and doors, my sarcasm (crutch), and abrasiveness... that I could be defeated by a three year old.</p>
<p>I love playing with kids and they seem to enjoy me. I usually have stupid hats on, or jerseys, or being really tall and generally goofy looking or something that's got to make me stand out as a "mark" for paying more attention to kids than adults. They give us life, they are the next generation... they are everything.</p>
<p>Anyway, the few times she's seen me (best friend's daughter) she asks me to help her touch the ceiling. After all, her house has tall ceilings and I'm a glorified step ladder wearing a Disney hat (no really) for conference wear. So... obviously.</p>
<p>I always stick her on the ceiling or a wall or whatever; more or less till I'm the one tired cause three year olds have boundless energy from breathing and infectious laughs that power them until they crash.</p>
<p>Again, I haven't seen her that often, but she asks when I'm coming and is excited by the idea of having someone that can stick her on a ceiling (though I was allowed to check out the princess fort last time, poor insulation and I have to lay on the floor in order to look in but I'd give it a good yelp score).</p>
<p>But as this is unpacking, and if the last week is any indicator, I'll be unpacking a lot,.. these have to relate some how. We were playing (more like I'm running away and she's chasing me) and she gets too excited and says "Daddy pick me up daddy!"</p>
<p>Broken. Puddle of emotions come flooding into my head. As well as a grimice.. cause beyond me not being Daddy... Daddy's not in the picture. Her mom freezes, I freeze.. I say "So who are you then".</p>
<p>"The big sister"</p>
<p>"That's my little sister" she says, pointing to her mom.</p>
<p>Tension fades.. but I knew as I related this story to my wife that I'd barely be able to tell it.. and that I could barely write it down now.</p>
<p>Because I've taken being a father as my ultimate prize since I was 15 apparently... and everyone deserves that rock, those big shoulders to sit on, to cry on, and to stick up on the ceiling.</p>
<p>I know part of her interest in me is probably that on some level, seeing friends, I match that imprint of a strong male figure; a role, however how small, however infrequent an occurrence, that I can play; that I am honored to be able to play.</p>
<p>That same imprint I worried my sister did with my girlfriend all those years ago. And as I know there is now, that same worry associated with that imprinting. But she turned out great (more than great), and I know this one will too. She's too strong and her mom's too dedicated to her success for her not to turn out awesome.</p>
<p>I'm still that 15 year old proud to be called Dad accidentally. And I'm a sappy, happy, emotional wreck, anytime I can go back to playing that part. Cause even acting that part for a few moments is validating.</p>
<p>After all, through all the work, the hours, the tears.. I only have one real goal at the end of this life: to be a great dad.</p>
