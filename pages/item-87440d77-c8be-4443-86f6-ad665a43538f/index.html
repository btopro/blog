<grid-plate disable-responsive layout="1-2"><p slot="col-2">Yes, and so many more problems from there. I am a dad, a believer, a developer, a coach, and opinionated about many a thing. I've worked in web development since the early 2000s and started on a DX 486 "laptop" and a large book about HTML in 1997.</p><img src="files/headshot581415.6000000006.jpg" loading="lazy" slot="col-1"><img src="files/headshot603198.jpg" loading="lazy" slot="col-1"></grid-plate>
<p>I am the project lead on <a href="https://haxtheweb.org/" target="_blank">HAXTheWeb</a>, which <a href="https://github.com/btopro/blog" target="_blank">powers this blog</a>, and is a large part of my purpose. From HAX I've <a href="https://oer.hax.psu.edu/bto108/sites/ist256/welcome" target="_blank">taught courses</a> at Penn State, I am an advisor to <a href="https://github.com/haxtheweb/hax-the-club" target="_blank">HAXTheClub</a>, mentor to dozens of students through <a href="https://haxtheweb.org/hax-lab" target="_blank">HAX Lab</a> and have become a better coach and human as a result of all the students I've met along the way.</p>
<p>I love the web. Hockey. Coaching. Teaching. and all the social scene that pops up around those things.</p>
