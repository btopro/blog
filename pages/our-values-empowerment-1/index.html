<p><span>Movements claiming to be without leaders are bullshit. Everything starts somewhere and with someone or a group of someones. It's critical in my mind, as the person starting HAX, to frame what it is that this movement has been built on.</span></p>
<p><span>We've seen the communities of the early 2000s. How they were built with such high hopes only to have corruption, greed and the traditional musings of the corporatists take hold; all the while hollowing out the community into a masquerade.</span></p>
<p><span>Claiming to be about diversity, then holding $1,000+ events.</span></p>
<p><span>Claiming to be about inclusion, then obtaining billion dollar but outs, purchasing other companies for market share and generally, being anything but inclusive.</span></p>
<h3 id="header-8c9bce30-a34e-4bdf-65ba-994036abf555"><span>This. Is. A. Different. Community.</span></h3>
<p><span>This is a community built on the premise that we will empower as many people as possible, to not need anyone else to stand on their two feet.</span></p>
<p><span>That means we don't make desktop apps to enslave people behind paywalls, custom plugins that only work with our resources, and competing vendor driven versions of the open source alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span>This is a community built on the idea that everyone has a voice. Everyone needs a voice, and that the web, a truly open, decentralized, free to publish, free from judgement web, is the last bastion of hope in a human history myriad with inequity.</span></p>
<p><span>Headless, doesn't just mean without body, it means without entity. Without a sole proprietorship that forever dominates the space. Without authority from an individual and their cronies as to who can and can not have a voice; who can and can not publish; who can and can not own their content; who can and can not distribute plugins.</span></p>
<p><span>This is a community that seeks to empower everyone. Raise the oceans that all boats may be raised, not just those fishing in boats that look like ours, at parties thrown only by our friends, funded by VCs who are only our VCs.</span></p>
<p><span>This is a community who's sole purpose is to empower as many voices as possible. With my dying finger tap on the keys or message via brainwave I will seek to empower any, and everyone I can to have a fluid expression of ideas. A funny expression of ideas. A deep, meaningful, philosophical expression of them and their truest form.</span></p>
<p><span>Not the form that's limited to simple text input.</span></p>
<p><span>Not the form limited by what data we can obtain off your photo likes and your video analytics.</span></p>
<p><span>A community that seeks to empower everyone to better express themselves, on the platform of their choice, with the devices of their choice, in the language of their choice, to the audience of their choice.</span></p>
<p><span>We are here to provide a voice for all peoples, not just the technical elites of the world but anyone who can put send input across digital device. We are the future of publishing. And we are a future without boundaries.</span></p>
<p><span>HAX is a community that bridges other communities. A place to bring in new ideas and mix them with the best of everyone else. A place of intellectual diversity, that doesn't see rich and poor as given separate lanes in society but given one platform, one method of expression so rich, so diverse, so robust, that it captures the totality of their existence and spreads it for all time, in all places.</span></p>
<p><span>We don't only work on high speed. We don't only work in Platform ABC. We seek to work any and everywhere people are. And we'd love to have you join us on our mission to empower the world to create a new web. A web without power brokers. A web without haves and have nots.</span></p>
<p><span>An accessible, sustainable, vibrant, and yet simple web for us all.</span></p>
<p><span>Will you join us in completing our mission? We need you. And we'd be nothing with out you and your voice.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for creating the future we need, together.</span></p>
