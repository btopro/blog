<p><span>A running back channel where my colleague tells me her ideology and I say awesome, cool, fun and then the way I self describe and explain I'm told is not a valid definition ;).</span><br/></p>
<p><span>This has been happening for 2 years and I love every time it happens as an observer of politics.</span></p>
<p><span>"that's socialist tho" about one phrase</span></p>
<p><span>"that's capitalist absolutist" about the next</span></p>
<p><span>It's curious the attempts to quantify what "The Joker" believes. There's a different political spectrum that I think is currently lacking in model. It's built on a different ideological principle.</span></p>
<p><span><span>left, right, up, down, whatever; is built on the premise of a unified governing structure. There are humans to this hierarchy. Technology though, and p2p direct connection, voice decentralized among all, transforms the nature of the landscape; meaning there are 0 sum equations</span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>"anarchy" is then what's beyond whats currently possible. Conceptually, you need water. If water can be assumed, much like Maslow said, you move up the needs hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span>But what if we could eliminate the need for people to require water? What is that quantified as? Alt-dimension?</span></p>
<p><span>A real example. Jonas Salk cured polio by making a vaccine. This could have made him very rich, but he instead didn't patent it and open sourced it (if u will). This suppressed the emergence of all but incredibly slim distribution market.</span></p>
<h2><span>Now what if I could print that at home?</span></h2>
<p><span>Technology & moral imperative imbued within it has the ability to eliminate archaic political binaries. By "socializing" a vaccine for "common good", then leveraging capitalism to produce and drive the cost of 3D printers to 0, then leveraging open internet to distribute plans.<br/></span></p>
<p><span><span>We effectively eliminate a health care concern which otherwise would be argued in archaic political binaries. This is the form of anarchy / radical individualism I subscribe to as the end point for *all* interactions and evaluations.<br/></span></span></p>
<p>Not "Oh that's socialism" or "oh that's capitalism" a different end goal that maximizes and liberates the individual. The tactic leveraged to get to that, I don't care, so long as it ultimately eliminates the infrastructure along the way. As technical example...</p>
<h2>HTML Abstractionism</h2>
<p>You write HTML</p>
<p>You write Webcomponents</p>
<p>You no longer need to keep writing HTML</p>
<p>You long term will eliminate HTML from most lexicon</p>
<p>We eliminate most developers</p>
<p>We replace them with high quality UX</p>
<p>Everyone is now a "HTML developer" without knowing it or caring.</p>
<p><span>In this paradigm, HTML was infrastructure. Broken societal code required to fix higher order issues. Much in the way our DNA is code and the vaccine for polio is hardening it, eliminating the construct so we can move onto higher order concerns and capabilities.<br/></span></p>
<h2><span><span>System admin abstractionism</span></span></h2>
<p>System admins run commands to set permissions.</p>
<p>DevOps devs encapsulate commands.</p>
<p>Docker executes DevOps commands.</p>
<p>Swarms execute bulk builds of Docker.</p>
<p>Functions as a service execute swarms.</p>
<p>Web component taps function as a service.</p>
<p>End user clicks button to tap web component to...</p>
<h2><span>Abstractionism</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Ends justify the means when it's toward the goal of abstraction, elimination of a current layer of infrastructure and replaced by better UX. Computers didn't take off bc they existed, they took off bc of GUIs encapsulating and running command-line, running c+, running assembly</span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Abstraction and encapsulation will. always. "eliminate" through stabilization the space beneath it.</span></p>
<h2>Abstractionism with Apache</h2>
<p><span>The world largely runs on Apache and no one knows what it is.</span></p>
<p>Apache runs on Ubuntu and no one knows what it is.</p>
<p>Built out of Linux and no one knows.</p>
<p>Compiled with Unix and...</p>
<p>You get the idea. It's a repeatable pattern and progression of technology that can't be stopped. It's why I'm not playing a traditional political ideological game as far as anyone can tell. Im playing the game being established as pattern of abstraction.</p>
<p>So..how best to abstract Education?</p>
