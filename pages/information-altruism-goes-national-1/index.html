<p style="width: 100%;">In 2006 I started Graduate school at Penn State. I didn't know why I was there other then to get an advanced degree and be exposed to different ideas. In that exposure though, I found my purpose. My thesis studied the spread of innovation at "A Large Land Grant Institution". While I loved doing the research and documenting it, it took a lot of time and paperwork.</p>

<p style="width: 100%;">The findings of that work in a few bullet points</p>
<ul style="width: 100%;"><li>Open source spreads when you give away knowledge, not code</li>
<li>You can overwhelm complex organizations because even complex ecosystems are made up of individuals</li>
<li>Institutions will seek to retain a restful state when pushed to the brink of transformation, leading them to gravitate to a new normal painlessly</li>
<li>Person to person we can change policies and perceptions with community and superior coding practices</li>
</ul>
<p style="width: 100%;"><span>I think I can do it again and at a much larger scale. I've always felt this way; that my research was something I'd repeat the pattern of but I wanted to do it at scale. I've got the first signs of that happening now.</span></p>
<p style="width: 100%;"><span>I've been donating time and coding efforts to help a government agency be more autonomous. I've been donating time doing independent studies in exchange for contributions to our projects. I've been seeking out to run events nationally to bring HAX camp and our web components to more and more people.</span></p>
<p style="width: 100%;"><span>And through all this donation, I can see people being attracted to free information, free approaches, free code but also, an ideology. That we can empower the maximal amount of people through standards based approaches to development.</span></p>
