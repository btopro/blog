<p style="width: 100%;">In 2006 I started Graduate school at Penn State. I didn't know why I was there other then to get an advanced degree and be exposed to different ideas. In that exposure though, I found my purpose. My thesis studied the spread of innovation at "A Large Land Grant Institution". While I loved doing the research and documenting it, it took a lot of time and paperwork and political movement (tribes moving on) in order to release.</p>
<h2 style="width: 100%;" id="header-0a2f0586-5fcb-0b32-03ef-2c9328e71a9b">All that in a few bullets..</h2>
<ul style="width: 100%;"><li>Open source spreads when you <b><i>give away knowledge</i>
</b>
, not just code</li>
<li>You can overwhelm systems because even complex systems are ultimately made up of individuals</li>
<li>Person to person we can change policies and perceptions with community and superior coding practices</li>
<li>As the new tribe moves, so moves the institution</li>
</ul>
<p style="width: 100%;"><span>There's lots of other take away's from the work that I had personally which are not provable yet I know to be true. The importance of counter-disinformation campaigns, the power of distance and wanting to be like "them" as long as "them" doesn't work down the hall, the power of targeted individuals to transform policy (or lack of policy), the power of one to replicate their desires in the world through many with the correct framing.</span></p>
<h2 style="width: 100%;" id="header-0a2f0586-5fcb-0b32-03ef-2c9328e71a9b">The PhD I'll never stop to get</h2>
<p style="width: 100%;"><span>I think I can do it again, at a much larger scale, and with much greater impact. I've always felt this way; that my research was something I'd repeat the pattern of but do it at scale. I've got the first signs of that happening now; that the gears of the machine have been thoroughly greased and that it's starting to lurch forward.</span></p>
<p style="width: 100%;"><span>So what is the new "research"? What is the new activist minded technology objective? Reduce the influence of political and institutional tribes through the direct empowerment of organizations and individuals to be free of the invisible structures that bind them.</span></p>

<p style="width: 100%;"><span>As usual right? When I started talking about my (previous) research project I'd actually started adding a disclaimer that said "I get pretty preachy so bare with me". DrupalCon Austin I even had a self-trolling intro that had fake alternate titles that I'd normally use (I mean the talk was Move over Edtech Vendors or some such thing).</span></p>
<p style="width: 100%;"><i>So enough <b>hyperbole</b>
;</i>
 what is it I've been doing, what will I be doing with the next year.</p>
<h3 style="width: 100%;" id="header-f06e0c37-2762-f426-41a0-9c9b829c40f7">Front one</h3>
<p style="width: 100%;">I've been donating training, support, workflows, and code to help government agencies be more autonomous. I've been trying to get a targeted group as far ahead of the rest of the game as possible because I know that once they do and have success, it will drive others to want to follow their direction (Distance and wanting to achieve what "<b>they</b>
" have).</p>
<p style="width: 100%;">By giving away trainings that "should cost $50k" we can start the process of collapsing the notion of what should be paid for and what knowledge is available for everyone. I don't know the immediate impacts of these efforts beyond the initial adopter; but I do know that based on my past efforts it's going to multiply exponentially within the next ~6-8 months.</p>
<h3 style="width: 100%;" id="header-a81dc74b-2b4a-e31e-c74a-898b0c221a4d">Front two</h3>
<p style="width: 100%;"><span>I've been donating time (as in I don't get paid but they get value and so do we) doing independent studies in exchange for contributions to our projects. I've been seeking out to run events nationally to bring HAX camp and our web components to more and more people.</span></p>
<p style="width: 100%;"><span>And through all this donation, I can see people being attracted to free information, free approaches, free code but also, an ideology. That we can empower the maximal amount of people through standards based approaches to development.</span></p>
