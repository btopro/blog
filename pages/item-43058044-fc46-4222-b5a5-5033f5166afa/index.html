<p>Day two I hung out in the Education Track most of the day. This is a series of phrases and important topics I learned about to bring back:</p>
<ul><li>Renewable assignment - David Willey concept; it's having students not do throw away work. This is effectively what I do in my class but never called it that so should start referencing the idea.</li><li>I was able to confirm with a friend that all I have to do to have HAX support LTI is set the same stuff I did in ELMS Media. <a href="https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/issues/2100" target="_blank">Issue created</a></li><li>Media wiki is still used and should be pretty easy to ingest the content from. Should write an importer for it to read off headings</li><li>A lot of great mentoring programs out there to engage people with 1st time contributions. I should sign HAX up for <a href="https://labs.codeday.org/oss" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://labs.codeday.org/oss</a></li><li>I wasn't able to catch a photo but when PHET's presentation gets posted I need to check out how they quantify the types of interactions from an a11y perspective</li><li>linktr.ee is interesting, nice and simple concept. I should do something similar as a "1 pager" <a href="https://linktr.ee/FLOSSMentoring" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://linktr.ee/FLOSSMentoring</a></li><li>Great mentoring quote: "Get people comfortable with the unknown and being a guide."</li><li>Need to define in a <b>CONTRIBUTOR.md</b> guide, How to go into different roles and non-code contributions</li><li>HAX Lab; start referring to the feedback loop as this. It's students learning web and joining an open source community. Then start tracking who's worked on what over time and highlighting them on the website</li><li>Need to add an "impact" section which is sorta like testimonials as well but who we're impacting, how many people, quotes, developers, faculty, staff, external devs, all touch points.</li><li>As part of community building internally, I need a formal HAX @ PSU logo, Ed tech joker student, and HAX intern badge. Then get stickers made for all 3 as deals come up.</li><li><b>NEED to apply for this <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose</a></b></li><li>Added two issues; one about CONTRIBUTION.md and README.md improvements based on data of how people use them</li></ul>
<p>It's funny, I sat rather passively at times through talks that really wouldn't have much to do with something I'd (traditionally) be interested in, and then there'd be a bombshell pay off, every time. I started passively opening my laptop just to google words I didn't know or search for more about the topics (and then ADD my way over to HAX and refining my talk). But without fail, I gained something each session.</p>
<p>A couple real game changers in there, especially around mentorship, community building, and simple ways to refine and prep our community for explosive growth. Tomorrow is just another step in the journey.</p>
