<p>Some decades, nothing happens. Other days, decades happen.</p>
<p>That sentiment about sums up what the last few weeks have been like. As if everyone began to realize what we built, all at once, after years in the dark. Ironically, this blog saw me stop blogged shortly after the "pandemic" was in full swing. I went from incredible optimism about where HAX was going with events planned in 2020, and then, reality happened.</p>
<p>Then I documented what it felt like and my concerns in those early days. And then, I started shoveling. A new house, a hockey rink built by hand, a community reorganization and then going underground to stop talking about the work completely, I am reborn, as is HAX.</p>
<p>One of the last posts on here I wrote about becoming version 4; being edtechjoker. The provocateur, I recently put away. It was no longer time of action in the shadows but instead to be open about the awesome work and community we're building.</p>

<p>I've had the phrase come up 3x now from 3 very different people: If you had a crystal ball and could see the future; where are things about to go? So while I hate predictions, I do enjoy talking about the future.</p>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-ab05ee87-288a-c1e6-aa80-a2fd648491b6">Documentation efforts grow a community "overnight"</h4>
<p>I've said for years that marketing and documentation are nothing without stability and stable UX. After the latter stabilized a few months ago, I started into marketing the fact people could use this. Now we're getting clamoring for more docs. Digging into doc efforts and launching new sits dedicated to documenting and putting arms around this community as far as totality will lead to ignition.</p>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-a41e184d-4a6f-cf25-ee7d-b32555c4d985">Tutorial ecosystem integrated into Merlin will ignite user advisory group</h4>
<p>We have a user advisory group that meets bi-monthly in order to better meet the needs of our end-users. Merlin has support for loading non-action oriented data (like lists of tutorials) but is not implemented yet. We've been cranking out tutorials both for end users of the editor as well as ways of importing and migrating data. Our user community will start to grow to the point we need more than bi-monthly.</p>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-78e147f2-6451-6f2a-bf29-8cd6255f445a">HAX takes over micro-site production space</h4>
<p>11ty but without the tooling needs. We might not hit all 100s on all metrics in lighthouse, but as support grows and we can improve our distribution pipelines, HAX will start to be viewed as an end user way of working on micro-sites of different use cases.</p>
<p>Currently we are working on using HAX with a new theme available in HAX-8 and new capabilities in order to build a small unconference site that looks like it's part of university branding. This effort is small, but will start to open eyes to the fact that HAX trasforms the web, and courses happen to be websites; but that anything is a website if we make the design appear that way.</p>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-17c41cd3-98bb-6896-561e-1bdf12f7d8df">What I'm not talking about</h4>
<p>A few realize I keep hinting there's more. A lot more going on behind the scenes that I can't talk about. And that's correct. I can confirm that we are talking to a lot of people about adoption and that we're working with them to ensure they have a successful experience with HAX.</p>
<p>We hope that their success only further grows the calls for more HAX for more use-cases. As these adopters and interested parties continue to ask good questions and we keep working on answers I hope we can reach the point of releasing less vague detail.</p>
<p>All I can say is that there's a reason I've been producing videos like this about the state of HAX</p>

<h3 data-original-level="H3" id="header-082fadfd-c39f-93eb-36ec-5077df1a2a23">Putting a smile on that face</h3>
<p>Project edtechjoker will no longer be the code name for an effort to improve output and reduce costs in higher education by aligning course projects with open source and needs of institutions; it will pursue this out in the open, as stated mission.</p>
<p>As a result, I can put away the persona created in order to make this a reality. Sure, I'll give students updated versions of this talk each semester just as I have the last 8 semesters I've taught, but the ravings of a joker-like character posting cryptic memes are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Welcome to the real version of me; not the multiple versions and editions that I've broadcast openly about creating on this blog in the past. There is no longer a reason to hide who I am, my intentions, and my motives. We are here to transform education, the web, and publishing to maximize creativity while reducing costs to zero.</p>

<p>And we will.</p>
