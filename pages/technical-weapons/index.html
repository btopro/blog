<p>Labels often set the narrative, or so liberals would argue. It's why they express deep concerns about the ways language is formed. Language can be used to divide, debate, and ensure that certain people and ideas are marked out of bounds or deemed acceptable, just by what surrounds them.</p>
<p>We worry so much about words, and so rarely about the places we place them. Sure, online your words can be used against you. Weapons in the wait, waiting to be taken out of context. But what about the store houses of those words? These books we fill with digital prose. Do we speak of them as weaponry?</p>
<p>A gun, is a piece of technology. By itself, it sits there lifeless. In the hand of a criminal, the gun helps shape intention. In the hand of a police officer, or a soldier, or a frightening home owner in the middle of the night, the story is different. There's a reason these many users pick up the gun. It's not because it remains lifeless and intention less, it takes form through what it's capable of.</p>
<h2>Algorithmic weapons</h2>
<p>Platforms, and more specifically, their owners, are the holders of powerful weapons. Seemingly intention-less, harmless data stores, just ripe with intention. Waiting to be set into action. An algorithm can be used to change housing prices, elect a president, alter the mood of the person being pushed negative or positive articles.</p>
<p>The algorithm is a complex, and complicated technical weapon though because often the intentions of those who make them are unknown. It's why liberals (and conservatives as well to a different extent) are concerned about the words they quantify, the metadata, the ability to codify -isms and separate. Further dividing the future through invisibly walled gardens.</p>
<h2>The invisible hand</h2>
<p>Technology shapes our perceptions. It shapes the way we interface with huge pieces of the world. What we buy, where we shop, then influencing where we walk, influencing every blade of grass we'll pass and molecule of air inhaled.</p>
<p>Raw, faceless, innocent technology (there's no such thing) does amazing things without us even noticing. How best to shape our technology than to wield maximal power? That's been the path of Silicon Valley the last decade. How best, to shape consumers to "improve their lives" by capturing dollars and tunneling them to the few from the many. Dollars and eye traffic in exchange for convenience.</p>
<h2>What then when we desire more than simply convenience?</h2>
<p>What then when things we desire beyond convenience become, convenient.</p>
<p>A small example</p>
<p>You want a website.</p>
<p>I can build you a website.</p>
<p>I can do all the work myself.</p>
<p>I can do all the work myself to build you a website in WIX.</p>
<p>I can give you the website and you'll never need me again (you didn't already there).</p>
<p>However, this convenience comes at a cost. You'll never be able to migrate away from it.</p>
<h2>Non vendors</h2>
<p>You want to be educated.</p>
<p>I can educate you.</p>
<p>You enroll in classes, pay thousands of dollars to get access to me.</p>
<p>I try to educate you... but there are many students. The topic is difficult and thus I must have specialized equipment.</p>
<p>You want to learn.</p>
<h2 class="hax-active">Worse</h2>
<p>Worse, you need to learn. You can't move in society without learning. You. Need. Me. My knowledge. My expertise. My ability. And yet, you can't have it unless you power forward, signing away the next 10, maybe 15, maybe 20 years of your life to ensure that you can have a future.</p>
<p>Was, the positioning of the information behind the institution, a weapon?</p>
<p>What's limiting in both scenarios is that an organization has abstracted you away from what you want. You want access to the individual with the knowledge. You want access to the thing at the end.</p>
<p>And in each case, knowledge has failed you. It's been weaponized against you. Those with knowledge able to manipulate (financially, dollars, eye traffic) those without.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Such a cruel marketplace.</p>
<p>A cruel world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What if College was free? What if we didn't need to pay for College and instead just got College service for free.</p>
<h2>Framed another way</h2>
<p>what if <i style="">Wix</i>
 was free? What if we didn't need to pay for <i>Wix</i>
 and instead just got <i>Wix</i>
 service for free.</p>
<p>Who has the most to gain in this scenario? The codification of knowledge brokering into the fabric of society. Saying that an institutional need is important for the individual success.</p>
<p>Is this so? Or is this the false reality we've been born into?</p>
<p>Must we implement solutions of the future based on structures of the past? Or can we go another way</p>
<h2>Individual as weapon</h2>
<p>What if we constructed technology to not live with the institution or the technology corporation, but instead to live with the individual? Why is it we accept that a computer can live in our hand and conform to our desires but yet access to information or the ability to self publish, those, those couldn't possibly be done without institutions, organizations, corporations.</p>
<p>How could we, the little people, ever be able to compete with the faceless mega corporations of our world? These Gods of the copybook heading. These titans of industry.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It's simple. We don't play there game. And the game, is that central structure exist and are funded and thus must continue to exist and must continue to be funded. There's no reason you need to continue going to traditional academia, but the belief that you do, keeps it going.</p>
<p>There's no reason you need to keep paying for websites, for hosting, to be locked into publishing options with no export format. To be bilked into thinking that because organization X recommends institution Y uses corporation Z's product, we must. We couldn't do it on our own.</p>
<p>That's just what they want us to think.</p>
<p>"We empower them, they do not control us" to quote a line from a house genre song I enjoy.</p>
<p class="hax-active"><br/></p>
<p class="hax-active">So it's that simple and idea.</p>
<p>If we intentionally built solutions that stemmed from the individual, could we eliminate the power structures at play. If we can make personal ownership convenient, powerful, usable, accessible, visually appealing, and locally controlled... will power flow away from the powerful and back to the people.</p>
<p>Can we reclaim publishing? Education? Knowledge construction? Media production? Can we reclaim all of these spaces back to the individual and defeat authoritarian edtech. We live in a technologically weaponized age. It's time we bring a pen to the gun fight and write a new future.</p>
