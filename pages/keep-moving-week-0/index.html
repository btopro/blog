<p>I've <i>felt</i>
 2020 coming for a long time. I still recall the realization. In 2012 I had a vision of what I had to build with my life. The pattern it would form. And then I remember in 2015 having some meeting as our team was growing and realizing that we were at the start, nowhere near the end of what the journey would be.</p>
<p>Since 2015, I've said 2020 would be a big year. I didn't know why and I certainly didn't see a global pandemic forcing a total change to the way people work and operate..</p>
<p>Yea, we'll get past where we are now, but I think it's important to look at what's happening in real time and keep a record of it. I'm going to try and do this weekly while times are as they are. I wrote the post <a href="/information-altruism-2-0">Information Altruism 2.0</a>
 while on a cruise just prior to everything going downhill in the US and so I'll quickly recap that one.</p>
<p>Information Altruism 2.0 week just prior to a new reality</p>
<ul><li>Plan to sail out of New York. Family concerned we were going. At this point less than 20 cases in New York. Information from lots of places about severity of this whole thing a bit mixed.</li>
<li>Day we left. NY declares state of emergency to reduce barriers to funds (they say)</li>
<li>After 2 days on the boat there's an announcement from the captain that we are starting "advanced sanitation efforts" going into effect immediately. We later see this is because of conversations between the US and cruise industry. Captain says no cases on board, just for precautions.</li>
<li>I'm immediately on edge the rest of the day, made worse by son eating something that causes him to get sick (he's developing food allergies, as someone with them I unfortunately see the signs). No one sleeps that night</li>
<li>We dock in Florida after getting cleared to land (making me think... is there the possibility they wouldn't clear us...). I don't sleep much that night, reading too much of what's going on.</li>
<li>We're on the boys constantly about washing hands, covering coughs, probably a bit too aggressively. I realize this is not a relaxing vacation.</li>
<li>We have the unlimited drink package. I spend the next 3 days ensuring that at least some part of this during the day while it's nice out is relaxing, knowing full well what will be in the future.</li>
<li>2 days before we get back to NY wife starts watching news. Says something about what's going on and I flip out about how I apparently am the only one worried about this at all. She realizes I've been worried about this, gets worried.</li>
<li>Night we are going to dock, neither of us sleep, worried they won't let us off and what the world will look like to come...</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-f8fbbd8f-97e9-443f-00ed-b929b1f336bd"><span>Week 0</span></h2>
<ul><li><span>They let us off after lots of delays and announcements about needing people to be patient. Wife does sign of the cross, relief that we won't be stuck in the harbor. Knowing 2 boats stuck (later to learn its like 10 globally) this was our primary concern - being stuck here.</span></li>
<li><span>We talk to the boys about the importance of not coughing or joking around when we get off. My primary concern is not the virus, it's how crowds and governments concerned about "the herd" will react.</span></li>
<li><span>We get temperature checked on the way off the boat. Incredibly tense right up to getting the O.K. your cleared to go. From there a cab ride over to our car, load up and bathroom before going.</span></li>
<li><span>We start the car and sit and explain to the boys that we will not be going to school tomorrow, school is out for 2 weeks and that we will be working from home, work is out for 3 weeks. I know these values to be a lie told be organizations trying to be optimistic. We make sure not to scare them and tell them everything is going to be O.K. but that a lot of people are sick and that no one has ever seen the world this way.</span></li>
<li>We stop at Aldi on the way back, hearing that things are hit or miss with stores we pick one that's in the Poconos along the way. It's got a lot of people but nothing crazy. We stock up on all kinda stuff and hit the bathroom before leaving.</li>
<li>My son touches the door after washing and I tell him he'll have to sanitize in the car. He gives me lip and I slow down time and the spinning of the earth, take a deep breath, put my hands on his shoulders and say "Son. I need you to stop with the attitude. No one knows what's going on right now and this is a very serious virus. We need to take cleaning very seriously so please, just do the things mom and dad ask." He appears to recognize dad is being serious (I'm sarcastic 90% of the time so its difficult)</li>
<li>We take all our stuff from the boat and leave it in the garage, concerned it could be infected. It's all sprayed down. Again, there's no indication of any issue on the boat, paranoia kicking in. We leave things there for days, slowly bringing clothing back in and what not after being washed / items wiped down.</li>
<li>We see our friends playing behind the house and the boys have to be told they can't go see them and play. They take this pretty well but I know are disappointed. I know though that we have to be away from people at least ~ 14 days to be in the clear from being around a lot of people in the NY area / boat. Wife and I have a serious discussion about counting how many days worth of meals we have and known how much food is in the house. She's a bit shocked at first and I say she'll feel better once she has this information because it's something we should always know anyway. I can see in her face that reality is starting to set in; that we're not going to snap our fingers and have our clear path forward as we did before. We have to literally plan for the worse. I make a bed in our guest room and clean things up a little because you have to have a room in case someone gets sick. I feel a bit bizarre while doing this activity. The thought of one of us getting (really) sick. I go to the liquor store and buy a few things since I think it'll close.</li>
<li>Monday - work reality starts kicking in, meetings, constant meetings.</li>
<li>Tuesday I go to the liquor store again as it's going to close by state order as they are all state run.Â We hold a virtual Saint Patrick's day with friends on Hang out. It's fun but also has those moments where everyone sorta nervous laughs when it comes to how long we could be seeing each other this way.</li>
<li>I'm up at 8 for work and the brevity of the new situation with work kicks in. I end up working ~10 hours then a few on some side things later. This pattern continues for the next 3 days, wed being the worst as something breaks at work and I work ~13 hours on that + side things. I've been in the basement for 17 of 18 hours just sitting at the screen. The bright spot of Wed though was getting to talk to my parents and sisters via group video. It was nice to hear their concerns and listen to mine about everything going on in the world.</li>
<li>Thursday is a bit of a breather; issues resolved. The kids are being oddly good considering all things. Wife has them on a bit of a schedule that she found a print out for and modified. She's amazing at knowing their needs and ensuring that the locals don't go wild.</li>
<li>Friday I started a "Un-code review" meeting which is open to anyone and is the last 2 hours of the work week to decompress, share the cool things we've been working on and get to see each other. These will most likely take the place of hax camps given the current state of not being able to have gatherings.</li>
<li>We have a great weekend being almost entirely disconnected from the computer (at least for work). We play Drawful 2 as a family (free because different companies are giving away activities to do with families) and the boys laugh like idiots at our drawings; we all do. We watch Frozen 2 as a family and the three of us play Minecraft and build a huge network of underground tunnels to a place with lots of minerals and lava. We take a walk to Patton woods and just wander around for about an hour. We've driven near the trail a dozen times but never stopped to go in. It's really confusing after the first few stops. Tons of intersections and forks in the road. I use it as a test to teach the boys about why we stop and look for weird trees to hang on or jump on; that they form mental stops in our mind so we know where we were when we don't have a map.</li>
<li>Saturday there's a rumor of a lock down order coming in which you won't be allowed out unless you are going to get food. Wife takes this info and uses it to justify going to the store and buying far more than we needed. She says if we don't end up using it then she'll donate it to the shelter, a lot of which she already has as they've been asking for donations.</li>
<li>Sunday I stream church on Facebook live, as I imagine a lot of people do. We had ~52 people hop on there, not bad for the first time they were getting everything setup and it just being our 2 pastors. The message was about how social distancing being heaped on all of us should give us a small window into those we social distance all the time. The poor, the homeless, people we don't get along with, those in nursing homes, anyone that we chose to avoid and not let into our sight. They experience isolation and distancing all the time and this was a chance for us to feel how devastating that is. To end she said "We'll see you all soon" and I've never wanted something to be so true when stated so simply.</li>
<li>Wife talked to her family via video chat; they did that for awhile, her setting it up. It's nice to hear her laughing with them. Me and the boys playing Mine Craft. Later, we talk about how bad things are going to get, what stories we've been reading, what things we've been listening to (we don't have cable).</li>
</ul>
<p><span>At this time, there's discussion of a combination of drugs that people are claiming is a miracle solution. Dr's seem mixed. Some incredibly cautious saying that it shouldn't even be brought up without more research. Others realizing how dire the situation is in some areas, looking at early results and saying that it needs to become part of the treatment plan immediately.Â </span></p>
<p><span>The president is also mentioning it on a regular basis; leading many blogs to write pieces about how recklessÂ this is. I'm optimistic because more people are being able to replicate the findings of this study through their own anecdotalÂ findings. We need hard research but this could provide a stop gap in the meantime.</span></p>
