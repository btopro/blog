<p>fall.. ...again</p>
<p>fall. AGAIN.</p>
<p>Find the edge... need to find the edge</p>
<p>fall. Get up.. get. Up.</p>
<p>Rain? Heat? It doesn't matter, we have to keep going to find that edge.</p>
<p>Push. Harder... there it is... now harder</p>
<p>AAAhhaaa, yes. Again. Again, faster. Let's keep going now.</p>
<h2 id="header-19886c9e-aa5a-0184-78d3-7c981bd43294">We've got this..</h2>
<p>I remember practicing my edgework growing up but on roller blades. A seemingly infinite source of time to play hockey for free. No rink fees, no ice times, no jersey costs, no coaches.</p>
<p>At Wilkshire it wasn't practice, it was just another Saturday. I won the Stanley cup too many times to remember at that park, playing against friends between the supports of a basketball hoop.</p>
<blockquote>"50 goal lead and we play to 100"</blockquote>
<p>Me and my best friend Justin would offer as a handicap to our friends, new to playing, never as addicted to the sport as we were. Anything to get more players, opponents, combatants to grind against. It didn't matter who, just that you had a stick, a ball, and a desire to improve.</p>
<p>Hello my name is Bryan Ollendyke, I am an educator who also leads a large open source software project, who also coaches and I have been obsessed with hockey since I was 7 years old.</p>
<p>I told my wife when we met (at 20), she would not become more important than hockey (although she *<i>eventually</i>* did), because I had a dream to chase, and no one was going to stop me.</p>
<p>When I was 13, I aged out of house league. My parents couldn't afford travel or scholastic programming, and so $50 seasons playing adult league or skating at the park with my friends were my "practices", my "ice time".</p>
<p>At 17, I tried to pick ice hockey back up, didn't have enough time to improve, and it was too late in the game, and was cut in high school. I went back to the park, started to train a lot more seriously; thought of it as training. I had had a site visit at Penn State, and they had a roller hockey team. I needed to be part of that team.&#160;</p>
<p>At 20 I made the Penn State roller hockey program; a club team, certainly far from the amazing D1 athletes we get to see every day, but the first step in my dream was there. After one year, we had mass turn over and 24 hours before club sports was to cancel our club, I found all the paperwork to become president.</p>
<p>It was my senior year, oh how all I wanted to do was be a senior. But my dream was still there, and now it involved paperwork to get to -- to win a national championship for Penn State.</p>
<p>I started using pink sticks that year. Looking back on it, 2005-06, something changed in me. I played for my friends, and when faced with a culture that wasn't a fit for me, rejected a spot on our D1 team to "just do the paperwork".. and skate with my friends who treated me a lot better.</p>
<p>That was a very awkward series of practices as the tone set in. I certainly wasn't the best, but it wasn't what you were supposed to do -- walk from the better team when asked to play. We had two teams. Roller hockey isn't quite like NCAA structure, so effectively you have a D1 and Club program in the same organization (I think some orgs can have 3+ teams now if the school is big enough!)</p>
<p>I'd bounce between the two teams, mending bridges with the future president over the years (who I saw recently as he's taking his kids to hockey now, great guy).</p>
<p>My final season playing, we had what seemed like a solid team but hit a rough patch and were last in the division 1/2 way through the year. I sent an email calling out everyone on the team individually by name, as well as myself, for needing to work harder. My goalie and I started hitting the gym, started working harder, it was our last rodeo.</p>
<p>The 2nd 1/2 of that season we went from out of the play offs, to winning Regionals -- a requirement if we were to get a nationals bid given our low record. Winning regionals, we made it to nationals. I was on the way to finishing my dream, all the work.</p>
<p>We made the national championship game, and we got destroyed (2-8). I remember sobbing, taking 1 last extra lap around center knowing I'd never get to play again. That this was the end. All that work finding the edge wasn't enough.</p>
<p>I went back to the lock room and told the boys that if they came back, I was coming back. That we weren't done until we had the prize. Something changed in me that day.</p>
<p>The next season we would nearly run the table on the entire East coast. We matched up against the team that stomped us in semis at nationals, and we stomped them (8-3). I still remember the feeling approaching the pile to celebrate with the boys and yearly re-watch parts of the journey that are on tape.</p>
<p>I went from the park, to cut in high school, to a national champion coach in 10 years. It's not the NHL. It's not NCAA. It's not even D1 or NARCH (roller hockey) championship. But it was my dream and I achieved it.</p>
<p>Not because of my coaches, facilities, equipment. But because I wanted it more. I was never the most skilled, though I have some decent hands and lovely edge work (slow and old for sure now ;) ).</p>
<p>I just wanted it more.</p>
<p>No matter the dream, big, small or somewhere in between, we can give our kids positive, growth focused environments with awesome teammates to chase those dreams. To create a culture where everyone wants it more, to push themselves beyond where they are today and to pull up and bring friends with them.</p>
<p>No matter who you are, or who they become, I want you and your kids to love the same sport I love - hockey.</p>
<p>My name is Bryan Ollendyke; I am an empathetic polymath with two boys that love hockey, and I am excited to be the next president of scyiha.</p>
