      <title>The Climb</title>

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>It was New years Eve 2018, or shortly before it. About 1 year ago, where I looked in the mirror and said to myself [paraphrase]</p>
<lrndesign-blockquote author="btopro" display-mode="default" style="width: 100%;">  <span>if we're going to get to 2020 and what's to come in that year... there's going to be a lot of pain this year</span>
</lrndesign-blockquote>
<p>I said then, that 2019 was going to be a climb, the death march toward what we are to become. The royal we as in me personally, but also the "we" as in our little team of core developers.</p>
<p>Wow, did I have no idea what would change for me this year at the end of 2018 leading into 2019... Not all full thoughts but here's what I can remember about the year.</p>
<p>My boss put in notice early 2019, like 2 days in, leaving me without a direct super visor until about July. My new manager is actively seeking to expand our project and champion it internally to complement our external championing. This was a huge change for me throughout the year and I think is starting to be reflected in some of the work I'm doing that won't be discussed more openly until July 2020.</p>
<p>I co-presented on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akn6keIYZ3k&feature=emb_title">Web Components with RedHat at DrupalCon Seattle</a>
, in which I announced <b>HAXcms</b>
 and showed an early prototype; with HAX ultimately being presented on at nine events I can think of off the top of my head by different members of the team, we've started to get outside feedback, and implementations, the most impressive of which being...</p>
<p>HAXcms can now be installed in Reclaim Hosting! HAXcms is still early on and hell it was incredibly early on at the time they added it, but we've already had contributions and UX reports from people using it via Reclaim hosting (a huge win). I met Jim and Tim at BYU API Unconference where we talked HAX, indieweb and immediately hit it off. They took me and Potter out for dinner the last night there saying that they wanted to be able to tell people they took us out to eat once before we "hit it big". Every time I've gone to BYU I've come away with something unexpected and meeting them, getting encouragement from people I really respect in the field, it meant a lot and was definitely not something I expected.</p>
<p>ELMS:LN has largely moved to a collective of projects as opposed to a single platform. Between HAX, HAXcms, HAXiam, LRNWebcomponents, WCFactory and ELMSLN itself, it's far more an organization of supported projects then one monolith.</p>
<p>While still supported, it is largely being driven by HAX related projects and efforts which will hollow out the Drupal theme layer in order to allow HAXcms themes to drive the UI layer. The platform removed (literally) <i>100s of thousands of lines of code</i>
 and over 50 modules this year as a result of advancements in web components. We also adopted V1 spec elements in production courses ~ March, meaning we successfully switched out all this code live with 1000s of students with all of I think 3 people reporting issues (because they were accessing at the exact moment the JS assets were all upgraded, a simple cache clear fix).<br/></p>
<p>After meeting Jim at BYU, he mentioned that I should attend Reclaim Hosting's Domain's conference. I not only had a topic accepted... but I finally resolved my abrasiveness and love of tech with what actually drives me and what I actually feel about education. If you want to see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eksr9y4nxQ4&list=PLpK5svzslv8qi8YZjqJqKS2hLEGwnUPF0&index=19">1st talk I've ever done completely free of the weight of perception, here ya go</a>
. I met <a href="https://twitter.com/OnlineCrsLady">Laura Gibbs</a>
 as a result of my rambling (mention her in the talk as a ranted) she started experimenting with HAXcms, which was still highly experimental and gave invaluable feedback about time to first usage and helped improve HAXcms to the point that I could teach with it in the Fall.</p>
<p>I'm sorry what? Yeah, I started teaching this Fall and began putting into action the "second research project" I mentioned at the Domain's conference which I call EdTechJoker. I wasn't supposed to teach... if the establishment had it's way. But over a long enough timeline, you get one person that can lower a ladder and recognize those that don't just talk change but live it.</p>
<p>I got my ladder, and after getting to present to the faculty of the college I graduated from 14 years ago, I think we're going to start shaking things up in a big way. The course follows a three act play:</p>
<ol><li>Web fundamentals / building yourself as a brand</li>
<li>Content Management systems / FOSS</li>
<li>Activism through technology selection</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The course revolves around students understanding how the web works, some of the technologies that ride on top of it but also learning how to better communicate through written and spoken word about technology. They had to create their own brand in order to communicate about tech topics as someone getting into the field. And so, 36 students later, here we are with 1 semester complete, high reviews, tons of UX feedback for HAX (24 items, 18 resolved already), and hopefully a lot more open minds about the way education and the web both work.</span></p>
<p><span>My off the hook, raw, real style of speaking and critiquing structures as well as pointing out how things actually work on the web I hope inspire others to enact greater change in society. We are more than the technology we select and it is more than just a choice, choices (all of them) have politics.</span></p>
<p><span>It was a highlight of my career, something I've always wanted to do and the tip of the spear as I'm currently slated to teach 46 in Spring of 2020 and while not the focus, the money I am getting from this course is going to go towards helping me bootstrap my dream; the vision I have of what I am to accomplish with this life...</span></p>
<p>With this additional flexibility, relationships forged, tooling enhancements and general need for community... I organized the 1st ever <a href="https://hax.camp">hax-camp that Duke hosted</a>
 and we had over 40 people come to learn about web components, including the whole HAXTheWeb core team.</p>
<p>I gave a "what's this community for" style lunch address in which I expressed better then I probably ever have been able to, the point of web components and what problem HAX is trying to solve (namely, decentralize power structures). You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_tEA9O9pco&t=1s">watch it here if you want</a>
, or attend <b>one of the four hax-camp's that are anticipated to take place in 2020</b>
.</p>
<p>Michigan (part of Apereo), DC (unannounced sponsor), PSU (hax-camp psu), Duke (hax-camp duke) are all planned for 2020 and I'll be attending all of them. I'll also have my HAX hockey jerseys that I'll be giving out in exchange for people completing scavenger hunts.</p>
<p>If you want to know what they are like, Check out <a href="https://blog.timowens.io/reflections-on-hax-camp/">Tim's take</a>
 or <a href="https://bavatuesdays.com/hax-the-web-haxcamp/">Jim's take</a>
 on what it is and why they are supporting HAX (both in the editor showing up in Reclaim hosting as well as financially in the case of hax-camp Duke). I can't wait to see them again in BYU this year and swap stories about where things are and where we're both going.</p>
<p>We also improved our tooling, did 4 refactors of our web components ultimately arriving almost entirely at LitElement based elements and seeing a rather ridiculous level of improvement to the HAX editor in the last year. If you don't believe me, I've included a video of where we were last year (I do these intentionally as I forget what we looked like).</p>

<h2>HAX specific facts to close us out</h2>
<ul><li>WordPress, ClassicPress, Backdrop, Drupal 7/8, ELMS:LN, and GravCMS all have HAX integrations</li>
<li>HAXcms now powers <a href="https://haxtheweb.org">haxtheweb.org</a>
, <a href="https://wcfactory.js.org">wcfactory.js.org</a>
, this website, <a href="https://hax.camp">hax.camp</a>
Â and dozens of OER course websites on hax.psu (to be fully announced in July 2020).</li>
<li>HAXiam is being used to teach courses at Penn State</li>
<li>HAX is now enabled in all our courses that use ELMS:LN and multiple instructors and instructional designers use it daily to create content</li>
<li>HAX is entirely LitElement + VannillaJS, leading to a leaner, faster package that produces content more accurately</li>
<li>hax-camp 2019 was a huge success, 4 more planned for 2020</li>
<li>HAX is currently having a formal UX audit performed by a government agency</li>
<li>EdTechJoker identified 24 issues in UX in HAX, of which 18 are already resolved and implemented</li>
<li>HAX capable elements now have 0 dependencies and only require supplying a <i><b>haxProperties</b>
</i>
 method</li>

      <title>Actually, curing edtech</title>
      <link>actually-curing-edtech-2</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p class="highlight"><span class="dropcaps dropcaps-i">I</span> read an article recently by <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2017/4/the-rise-of-educational-technology-as-a-sociocultural-and-ideological-phenomenon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">Educause Review</a>
 and I wonder if your able to pick up on what I did. Before reading ahead, take a minute and read through their article. It's a good take on the state of affairs in education as it relates to edtech...</p>
<h2>Ding</h2>
<p>Ok class, pencils down. Now; Who can tell me what is wrong with the following argument?</p>
<ul><li>We live in a techno-centric worldview where technology is the driver of outcomes</li>

<li>Education is historically non-profit driven, while technology is profit driven</li>

<li>Therefore, part of the commoditization of education can be attributed to edtech</li>

<li>
<em>To fix this we recommend kindly helping to inform our edtech overlords sliiiightly better in theory to maaaaaybe help us actually have the thing we want</em>

<h2>We ask stations to pause for a moment of head-esplod-ification</h2>

<p>What, the, actually F is that!? So let me get this straight. Education is important as a social good, it's something that generally speaking still isn't completely driven by a pure profit motive. It's situated somewhere between socialist utopia (Everyone has access <em>maaaan</em>
) and capitalist utopia (Everyone competes and knowledge is part of that competition). And you address concerns of "Weeellll it seems like these technology vendors have no real foundation in education / instructional principles" with the equivalent of the "meh" emoji followed by a hands up in the air?
I read this article and went off on a total drill down rant on twitter (unfortunately against someone who's an edtech provider and he wasn't the target it just sorta happened that way). They for once, finally, omg finally identify the problem: That edtech producers don't work in Education and have almost no clue wtf they are doing other then making something shiny. There is little to no research behind what they do. <strong>AND THEY ARE PURELY PROFIT DRIVEN</strong>
. So check, check, check and then your conclusion is... but oh well, let's keep on keeping on while acknolwedging this is the case.
<em>{deep breathe}</em>
</p>

<h2>NOOOO.</h2>

<p>You will not fix the problem of a techno-centric society driven education further to the brink through edtech (article's point, not mine) BY REPEATING THE SAME DAMN PATTERN WE HAVE BEEN. Stop. Stop with this bullshit narrative that magically those in silicon valley, or worse, the very students you bring in to train, build up the knowledge of and send out the door are some how inherently supporior at the production of educational technology then the institutions that are doing the training!
This false narrative is what perpetuates the cycles of us training people, them leaving and immediately forming companies with knowledge of our problem space and then selling us into insane contracts for things that aren't actually hitting the mark.</p>

<h2>Don't believe me?</h2>

<p>Instructure, all the rage with C levels becasue they adopted Twitter Boostrap and React in a world driven by home-made solutions, did just that. A bunch of students said "blackboard sucks" and threw something together rather quickly which is superior to it. Think for a second then... why can't we collectively do the same? NO! </p>

<h2>Why can't we do better then that?</h2>

<p>If you want to stop edtech driving us around collectively and being part of the techno-centric worldview that forces education to be more about money then learning, then you've gotta defeat this narrative. I view our team and those we collaborate with as being among the first to plant that flag in the ground. We are educators, trainers, designers, technologists, students, learners, and administrators all working together with a singular purpose to solve this problem. We are going to deliver solutions that are not profit motive driven, that are more open, more accessible, <em>have research backing</em>
, and are ultimately better then anything you will see produced external to education.</p>

<h2>Don't believe it?</h2>

<p>Watch us! This is just a small glimpse of what we have coming to all systems near you..</p>

Chapter 1: The Shower</h2>
<p>A Developer takes a shower. A Developer closes his eyes, breathes deeply, and presses the water over his scalp and eyes and face. When hands press against the eye socket in the pressense of light, synapese fire off randomly. These random firings of "light" dance in the retina of the Developer seeking the answer to a problem. The retinas of the developer see the sparks trickel away as color fades back in.
The developer pauses.. then does it again, this time focusing on those whips of ocular static fizzle away. The whips form a pattern that looks like a central star that everything is firing out and away, creating their own central stars to fire out and away from. The occular misfires form a fractual image in the minds eye.</p>

</a>
Chapter 2: The fractal</h2>
<p>The developer talks through how a fractal could be used in the design of a system. The developer writes down the fractal. The developer sees a video the next day expressing, visually, the concept of divergent ideas spawning ohter divergent ideas, expressed as a series of hexagons firing off at a tangent and forming new hexagons. The developer recreates the pattern on a whiteboard and begins to theorize how this pattern could be used to represent systems.</p>

Chapter 3: The monster within</h2>
<p>The developer explains this to one other person over two hours. The manager is excited but leaves with: "Who else would ever understand how any of this works though." The developer smiles, "I guess I'll just have to build it to find out". The developer works on prototypes, burning through hundreds of hours beyond what normal projects there are to pursue. The idea is like a dagger in his mind. He starts shutting down from the rest of the world and focusing solely on this one idea. This one fractal.</p>

Chapter 4: The friend</h2>
<p>He explains an early prototype to a friend. The friend is intrigued but doesn't get it or see how it's the fractal. The developer keeps pushing on, convinced there is a fractal there. The developer makes prototype after prototype, pouring through hours of tutorials and producing posts and videos looking for someone to understand what he's claiming to have discovered. No one gets it. Again, and again, over the next 2 years, the developer repeats this cycle, trying desperately to get someone to understand the picture in his mind now layed out as code and directory trees. Symlinks and .gitignores. But no one. Gets it.</p>

<p>Until... Someone does. Two people actually. And then from two, three, and three, four; and four, five; and five, a dozen, and dozens. Until the fractal no longer is some obscure concept it's the way of visualizing and attacking the problem. The Developer is no longer a developer, and no longer is a young developer either...</p>

Chapter 6: The team</h2>
<p>The Developer is part of a team. A Team hell bent on innovation. A Team that doesn't accept the world and the educational system the way it is but dreams of what it can be, what it will be.

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>I find innovation best comes from the cross-sections. The weave between spaces tends to breed the best ideas of the two fabrics to create something new. It is this mentality that's caused me to look outside the island of edtech first, always asking "What can I bring back to our space to make it better?". 10 years ago, that was Drupal. I evangelized Drupal everywhere I could, wrote hundreds of modules, positively impacted tens of 1000s of sites in and out of education while making it possible for individual developers to leverage open source automation to do awesome things. Today I write to talk about the next thing I want to bring back to our island which I think is <em>the</em>
 technology to bring about an open ecosystem for the Next Generation Digital Learning Environment (NGDLE).</p>

Webcomponents explained</h2>
<p>That technology, is webcomponents. Webcomponents, which you can find out more about on <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/" rel="nofollow">webcomponents.org</a>
 is a four part browser standard that fundamentally changes what's possible in web based application development. The important thing to know is that webcomponents allows developers to define <em>custom HTML elements and expresses how the browser handles them</em>
. So, bringing this back to education: <em>We can use this technology standard in order to build <a href="https://github.com/LRNWebComponents/">pedagogically focused, valid, HTML tags</a>
</em>

Quick note</h3>
<p>This is a standard that all major browser vendors have committed to adopting and largely have, though polyfills are required to get full browser support. It also is leaving the IE6/7/8/9/10 world behind (the good news is, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/microsoft/12087103/Microsoft-to-kill-off-Internet-Explorer-8-9-and-10.html" rel="nofollow">so has Microsoft</a>

NGDLE backstory</h2>
<p>For <a href="http://btopro.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">four years</a>
 I've been building <a href="https://www.elmsln.org/" rel="nofollow">ELMS: Learning Network</a>
; trying to build a platform that can produce and sustain innovation in educational technology. For about that long, Educause has talked about the concept of NGDLE; what it might look like, what it might do, how to do it. Because it's a big concept to unpack, it's taken a few years to get people all on board with the idea and to agree that it's not an LMS (much like webcomponents was proposed in 2011 yet didn't become a real thing implemented until 2016). Because of the patterns of behaviors and methodology of ELMS:LN I currently consider it the only public NGDLE. For that reason, we're misunderstood but if NGDLE is Lego'ing / app-ifying the LMS; ELMS:LN wants to be the grid-plate. The fundamental base-plate to be plugged into. A routing system to stitch it all together and satisfy the need that no vendor will ever provide: a middleware to pull our ecosystems together.</p>

So how do we all lego</h2>
<p>Ok, so back to webcomponents. If we have a gridplate (you could provide your own, I'm not suggesting ELMS:LN be the only one) then we need lego bricks to plug into the board. But what fits that paradigm? Webcomponents allow you to take simple forms of HTML and build it up into increasingly complex elements. Let's look at a simple concept of a custom tag and how it would start to get towards pedagogically centric HTML.</p>
<p>Just like HTML, custom tags can go into other custom tags. It can also use and retain semantic meaning just like HTML markup. So let's imagine that we had a semantic, custom element that provides the same thing as above. Now we have a tag called <code>paper-button</code>
 and every time I want to do above, I put that tag. Ok, now let's say I want a comment card. A comment card might be:</p>
<p>Which I can then use in something bigger and now I have a tag called <a href="https://lrnwebcomponents.github.io/lrnsys-comment/components/lrnsys-comment/demo/#" rel="nofollow">comment-list</a>
 or <code>discussion-board</code>
. A discussion-board could be made out of any number of other smaller lego brick tags. Now I wire it up to a backend to save the data and I've got a fully functional HTML element that can be shared and remixed anywhere and so long as someone provides a backend to store it, it's going to work.</p>

</a>
Critical concepts that webcomponents provide to NGDLE if we do this right</h2>
<ol>
<li>Visual consistency - right now when using multiple systems everyone decrys the cognitive load on students. webcomponents can provide a common visual design language and templated approach to help alleviate this. Everything will feel like it's the same (even if it's not)</li>

<li>Accessibility - Because most accessibility mistakes happen when HTML is created, this allows us to make elements with high accessibility baked in, eliminating the ability for end-users to make that design element inaccessible.</li>

<li>Maintainability - If we were to produce a tag such as <code>lrn-assignment</code>
 that expressed an assignment's properties visually, we can now swap out the guts of that tag and so long as the properties going into it are the same we don't need to update any existing content produced.</li>

<li>Interoperability - By design, anything that imports the custom element (which is jsut an HTML file supplying the definition of what to do with that tag) will work. These will work in any system because it's the user's browser that's unpacking what it is and the specification itself gives the element definition and encapsulation.</li>

<li>Standards based approach - by using a common methodology for front-end creation, we can standardize the UX and interaction patterns of our users and allow developers to all work together and utilize each other's lego bricks.</li>

<li>Schema without Schema - We can start to wire up our custom elements to be schematized for indexing by search engines or our own advanced crawlers, ensuring there is additional semantic meaning to our content no matter where it lives. This has <a href="http://oerschema.org" rel="nofollow">huge implications for OER</a>
 for example.</li>

<li>Common Authoring - Because <a href="http://haxtheweb.org" rel="nofollow">we just made this</a>
 and it works anywhere.</li>

</ol>

</a>
Anywhere?</h2>
<p>Yeah, anywhere. HAX is another step towards my vision of NGDLE and the solutions we can craft when we work in this approach. An authoring experience that can pull data from anywhere and assemble it in a standards based format (HTML) which can be deployed anywhere. Imagine having identical authoring and instructional capabilities regardless of where an instructor is assembling a course. Open system? Do it in the open. Closed to the institution? Do it in the LMS. Training exercise or learning module on a random blog? Yeah, with an NGDLE based authoring approach, everything can be a mini-LMS and everything can feed other things to make new Learning experiences.
In the coming months through demonstration, documentation and seemingly impossible levels of progress (webcomponents + elmsln make application development trivial) I'll begin to show the path towards anyone building an NGDLE. What it provides users, How we are sharing things across institutions and systems, and how we can start to dissolve all learning systems into the NGDLE based worldview to provide better solutions for instructors and more engaging learning spaces online for learners.</p>

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>This is based on a submission to the Penn State open innovation challenge for 2018. I like to post my ideas to my blog in addition to my submission so that I never lose them. This one is about the logical extension to HAX for desktop over 2018 which could be utilized to decentralize instructional experience creation. If this sounds of use to your institution, good, let's work together on it.</p>

Problem</h2>
<p>Faculty and staff have no idea what they can use at our institution. No matter how many registries of information or solutions we provide, people will need to practically be marketted to just to know they exist in the sea of information about what makes the university work. Beyond this, there is no way to provide continuous innovation to those not at high-touch units which work hand in hand with faculty to produce highly experimental course spaces and approaches. Even if we could find the things we need, very few of them talk to each other, their user experiences are all over the map, and most aren't very good for creating materials without needing to understand technical topics (like HTML). This isn't a PSU specific problem, Duke has an illustration that highlights 93+ solutions available to faculty, many of which don't talk even if they knew them all.
How to solve the problem of finding and once getting there creating engaging experiences?</p>

Vision</h2>
<p>This is the vision of HAX, a distributed instructional creation tool. <a href="http://haxtheweb.org/" rel="nofollow">HAX can be viewed as a public demo here</a>
. The important thing to keep in mind with this is that desktop publishing of applications can be done using HTML, making them far easier to build when you just make it work on the web. Imagine if users could log into the app on their laptop or phone and just create. Creating a new course? Start one on your local machine and with the press of a button publish it to Canvas, Drupal, ELMS:LN, GravCMS or a static website. Want to see what colleagues have shared from their courses? Fork their materials by searching an institution protected repository right from the app or connect to global shared object repositories. Instead of trying to market to faculty and staff what services are available, have people utilize a unified app which connects to the registry of everything available to them for teaching and learning.
Want to stream video? Upload it to the app and it'll publish it to youtube or the video provider the university supports. Want to create H5P but don't understand hosting? Build it in the app and it'll save to the correct, FERPA valid location. Want to create a slideshow? Drag and drop a series of images which automatically get uploaded to Amazon S3 and then click a UI to "build" your slideshow. Worry about accessibility? HAX will take care of it for you automatically and without the ability to make in-accessible content. Content in HAX is accessible by default due to the game changing technology called <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/" rel="nofollow">webcomponents</a>

          <![CDATA[ <p>The family gathered, friends came and we all shared a laugh.</p>
<p>Then, he pulled me aside. My oldest was concerned as to why he wasn't getting ready for bed yet. "I have to start getting ready for bed can I brush my teeth?" A 7 year old is never one to demand they be put to bed when up snacking and well, not sleeping. But this wasn't an average day. This was December 24th.</p>

"Because, I have to get ready for bed and go to sleep so Santa can come at Midnight!"</h2>
<p>He was very excited for Christmas this year, more so then any previous. His cousin was in town, his brother was also at an age he could grasp the brevity of the day. It is among the peak of the family joy meter when it comes to kiddo happiness.
He laid down and made me rush through prayers because he had to go to sleep. He is a wonderful, funny, thoughtful little boy; and after all the hours worked, time on this machine worked, it is incredibly rewarding to sit back and watch them. I'm not taking these years for granted, I know they are fleeting; I can barely hold my boys at night to put into bed or rock them to calm down after a bad dream.</p>
<p>I got my wife a book this year called <em>The Book of Happiness</em>
. And it's a large, blank book. It's a replica from the movie Up that the main character and his wife build and I was going to write in it but instead, I left it blank. Because it's not my story to write and build; It's our story, and the pages of our lives we write together are the ones we need to document together. The smiles from a surprise trip, or a long awaited one, the tokens of places visited, artwork, treasures. These are all we'll have left one day. Not the presents, the wrapping, the food; just the few single pages of the incredible story we wrote together.</p>
<p>Right now though, we're in the think of our story. I pray our pages are many in this book, but no matter what the ending, these will always be years colored with pure golden sunshine. The light that only children bring to our lives as parents. The golden years of our little family growing together, as we all get to be apart of a memorable phenomena:
<em><strong>Pure Joy</strong>
</em>

          <![CDATA[ <p>dudes crying.
dudeâs crying.
dude, is, crying.
This dude, has been crying uncontrollably for the last hour about how wonderful my son is. I'll recall for you what happened and it won't need much more then that.
We went to a <a href="http://borntobebravetour.com/" rel="nofollow">father son thing about fatherhood and raising sons of integrity</a>
; youth group sorta stuff, a good mix of message, prayer, and fun. The part I wasn't ready for was the label breaking. We had a part where we talked about labels; labels placed on you by others and that you know who you are and you know who God wants you to be and that no one else knows that and can define those labels, those gifts you've been given.</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-label" class="anchor" aria-hidden href="#label"><svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path>

Label</h2>
<p>So for this part, your supposed to ask each other what a label people have given you has been (this is admittedly geared toward like 7-15 years old so that's more like teenager question). So I asked him if anyone's said anything mean to him or called him a name at school and he said no (we had very different school experiences apparently already).
So I thought and went, ok, well I'm going to label you Smart and wrote smart on a duct tape (sticker) and placed it on him. Without being asked, he grabbed the pen and wrote on my sticker "Loved" with tears in his eyes he put it on me. I asked why he was crying (afterwards) and he told me "sometimes when people say really nice things about me I feel like... I feel so happy that I start to cry".</p>

Stars+2</h2>
<p>After this we sat and listened and watched some more. Heard some good stories about integrity (that cheez wiz has none) and how society will tell you that "being a real man" is about money, power, influence, attractiveness, having a wife; and that that's not what's really important. That it's what's on the inside, the person behind the labels and the "things" and the attractiveness that really matters. It was an uplifting message that we all have a role to play and that it's not what you have on the outside but how you live your life that really matters.
We had to leave early because of school early in the morning so we waited for intermission and headed out. The building was on top of a hill overlooking the valley and it was very dark up there outside of the parking lot. As we walked toward the car I scooped him up on my shoulders and instead walked toward a pond in the dark. He wanted to know where we were going and I said he'd see when we got there.
As we got beyond the flood lights of the parking lot I told him to stop and look up. The sky lit up with far more stars then we see at our house.
âwoahhhh thereâs so manyâ he said.
"You see those?"
âYes poppaâ
âI love you more then the stars in this skyâ
âwowâ¦ thatâs so niceâ¦ I love you more then the stars in the skyâ¦ plus 2â
âwhen Iâm older likeâ¦ 8 and your 54; Iâll still love you cause your the best poppaâ
I've been the happiest wreck I've been probably since he was born.</p>

          <![CDATA[ <p>Institutions and employees within them will remain at rest unto acted upon by an internal or external force. Externally, this is the preasures of society, markets and learners demanding change. Internally, this is tempored radicals within the machine knowing the machine needs to change. But change is more complex then that, because preasures for change and the path toward change are not linear. It also means those with motivations to not remain at rest will exponentially increase in their ability to not stay at rest. One innovation after immense frustration kicks off dozens as opposed to one leading to one more.</p>

The Btopro Flow of Educational Innovation</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="innovation.jpg"><img src="innovation.jpg" alt="Btopro's Flow of Educational Innovation" style="max-width:100%;"/></a>

In my spectrum of educational innovation, I place Ease of the staff to manage on the same axes as frustration. Something is either easy or difficult, not much to note there. Vertically we see Sameness and Innovation. Now, The easier something is, the more the same it will remain. Once we've transitioned a technology to a resting state, say ethernet cable in the walls for Fiber connectivity, then we'd like it to remain the same and be easy to maintain (I know network engineers will say it's actually frustrating as hell and the same but let's imagine here). Once that technology is at rest and stabilized, we really don't want there to be innovation in that space.
Innovation, both it's pursuit and what it takes to pursue, is a different animal. Innovation forces the individual and the organization to strive toward frustration. Frustration and perserverence lead to growth. For example, backend application development is very difficult at first. But once one masters MySQL and PHP (as examples), and then masters Ubuntu (operating system); now, the frustration subsides and the exponential inversion of the frustration, arching towards innovation can occur. And not just occur, but do so at scale.</p>
<h3><a id="user-content-virtualization" class="anchor" aria-hidden href="#virtualization"><svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path>

</a>
Virtualization</h3>
<p>Another example. Now that you've mastered PHP/MySQL to make the underpinnings of an application. And Ubuntu for it to ride on. Learning Docker and doing something meaningful with it is relatively trivial. Using knowledge of Docker, you can virtualize and deploy the once impossibly complex and frustrating task, an infinite number of times. Your command of 1 application was greater effort then the now command of 1000s. And this, from an organizational perspective, is what leads to transformation.</p>

</a>
The pathway to transformation</h2>
<p>What process are you engaged in now that will keep things the same? Is it reliance on legacy solutions? Perhaps staffing that "won't get us there" (whatever there is). Then it's possible you should accept your sameness and relegate the easy, stationary tasks to those that work there now. You must achieve stability with those best suited for stability. (note the bold) <em>This is also an incredibly important function of any organization. Without sameness, without ease of management, you do not have an organization to manage.</em>

But the process of transformation of practice, of digging in and fundamentally enhancing what was frustrating into what is now easy (and eventually the same even if previously infinitely difficult) is a different task. It's not the same. It's not better, it's not worse. There may be more conferences to submit to and it might have more "glory" as we as humans tend to glorify and appreciate different and new more then old and stable. However, these are two very different car engines : innovation, and sameness.</p>

</a>
Two engines</h2>
<p>It's critical that we as bringers of the new digital revolution realize this. If we are to bring our institutions into the future, we need a different set of engines in order to do so. You don't replace the HVAC system with a next generation HVAC system while maintaining the current one. You maintain the current one, explore new ones, and then when the time is right, start to make the switch. <em>We need to focus our organizations on the future and dedicate thought leadership and technical expertise specifically toward that</em>
. Where are we going is just as critical as having those maintain where we collectively are now.

<p>
It's not the first time it's come up, though this was definitely a more direct line of questioning then is typical. It's these promptings though that convince me [sic] that we live in a simulation, or at least that I am. Nothing else could explain why these mile markers are placed in my path except divine intervention (which a simulation would surely be someone more powerful then us placing the VR googles on the Matrix bodies; but to be less silly...)
We are reaching a critical inflection point in the near future. The point of singularity where I don't know where the road goes. It's one thing to project in 2015 the things we'd be working on by 2020. It's another to present an idea and call it Structured Anarchy about the systematic messiness of application development in institutions (education being just one). And.. it's an entirely different feeling and experience living the pieces falling into place. Seeing the alliances and relationships form, feeling the momentum (of what?) and the hair on the back of your neck stand up in disbelief that things could keep going the way they have been going. As we progress, let me assure you of one thing:</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-this-was-all-according-to-plan" class="anchor" aria-hidden href="#this-was-all-according-to-plan"><svg class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16" aria-hidden><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path>

</a>
<em>This was all according to plan.</em>
</h2>
<p>See, it's like the human genome project. It takes years of effort to get the first 1% done and then after that a long time but less so to get to 2%. Then, after hitting that critical theashold (whatever it is, 10% we'll say) the rest is finished in a matter of weeks. How is this possible? There are 100 things and you did 10 in x time, the other 90 will surely take x*9.
It's because programming (and deprogramming in the case of genome) can stack and repurpose knowledge and capabilities. Unlike lifting 100 boxes one at a time into a truck, with patterned software development once we lift 1 box we've liften 10. And once we lift 10 boxes we now can lift 100. The pattern of exponential growth in capability to solve problems is because of the field itself. You solve one problem in a modular way, you roll out the modular way in a pattern, and now you've got an exponential amount of capability just in that one problem space. Now modularly solve the next, and the problem those create, and combine these solutions to solve that one. Suddenly your exponential capabilities are solving things exponentially.
It doesn't happen over night. These things take a very, very long time to develop. When I think back to the first outline designer I made it's hilarious. I "knew javascript" enough to slap some code together; but I couldn't make new code. I couldn't design things well beyond what I could do in MS paint. I didn't have version control. I didn't have a method of getting feedback and testing aside from hitting refresh tons of times.
Now, I saw a huge aspect of the problem space solved in a single day. Is it because we already built that and now know what it is? Partly yes, past knowledge of the problem helps frame future solutions for sure. But the libraries and techniques we can now leverage mean that when we solve 1 problem (say... a button design) we're now solving that "problem" in every future project we take on. In this way, things that once took weeks and months of development (I'm not talking planning / ideating, coding, typing things, testing, etc) now can be done in hours and days.
This is because our backend modularity and pattern based design now has a place on the front-end thanks to Webcomponents. Now we can pattern based deploy our modular front-end assets. Meaning that when we make a button better, we've made them all better. Meaning that when we need to build a new thing, the button can be assumed. Now button sounds small (and it is) but let's replace button with modal, card, menu, block, layout, grid system, navigation pattern, form entry method, json data loading, ANYTHING. ANY. THING. If we can build it as a component then we can repurpose it into others. This almost doesn't feel like coding based on how coding has felt the last 10 years, this feels like building things with legos (and I looooooved legos growing up).</p>

 and these are just the ones we've shared so far. When we get into full on apps (powering parts of elmsln) there are another 10 full on headless applications that are running there.
These little pieces; these little things. While we've been putting out these ripples (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhD6Y77eXmc" rel="nofollow">and some are very cool</a>

      <title>The perfect cup of coffee</title>
      <link>the-perfect-cup-of-coffee-2</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>(post via <a href="https://twitter.com/btopro" rel="nofollow">@btopro on twitter</a>
)</p>
<p>good people of the internet who drink coffee. I am about to embark on a delicious journey. A journey of mind altering chemicals pour perfectly at home. A journey, into <a href="https://twitter.com/DeathWishCoffee" rel="nofollow">@DeathWishCoffee</a>
</p>
<p>I remember as a child, and seeing the tools of my father or grandfather's workshop and thinking "wow... how did they amass all those tools" and they'd tell me "one at a time son. One at a time" (this is not my reality this was stolen from Gran Torino). Today. I have my toolshed</p>
<p>The difference, is my toolshed is stocked with what assembles the perfect cup of coffee. Let me tell you, how to experience the perfect cup of Saturday afternoon coffee (I should NOT be drinking this this late in the day I'll be up for days).</p>
<p>First. A gallon bottle of distilled water and a packet of <a href="https://twitter.com/thirdwavewater" rel="nofollow">@thirdwavewater</a>
 . Mix the two. Then get clear 20 oz coffee cup and fill it with the water almost to the top. Now get a <a href="https://twitter.com/BonavitaWorld" rel="nofollow">@BonavitaWorld</a>
 tea kettle with a digital readout and pour the water into it. Add 1 oz for steam loss</p>
<p>Next take out an <a href="https://twitter.com/aeropresscom" rel="nofollow">@aeropresscom</a>
 coffee maker and <a href="https://twitter.com/DeathWishCoffee" rel="nofollow">@DeathWishCoffee</a>
 . Put 5 scoops (small scooper) of death wish into a grinder of your choice (I have a 14$ proctorsillex by <a href="https://twitter.com/HamiltonBeach" rel="nofollow">@HamiltonBeach</a>
). Pulse grinder till beans are just above expresso level grinded.</p>
<p>Start the Bonavita set at 195 degrees and select the hold setting. You want 195 not 195 then cool off to 193 or some other garbage temperature. Using the inverted pour method (<a href="http://coffeenate.com/how-to-make-coffee-with-the-aeropress-aeropress-video-tutorial/" rel="nofollow">described here</a>
) pour the beans in and then slowly pour water.</p>
<p>Let sit for 1 min ensure you've filled to the 3.5 line in the aeropress. After 1 min, apply "the btopro method" which is to press coffee to the 3 line (so .5 lines) to obtain suction, then slowly pull up on the brewer pump. (wwwhhaaaaa you say?)</p>
<a href="https://giphy.com/embed/91fEJqgdsnu4E" rel="nofollow">https://giphy.com/embed/91fEJqgdsnu4E</a>
<p>If successful, you will be able to pull air up from the cup through the filter without it moving, keeping a seal with the beans so that nothing leaks through but air pulses through the upper portions of the bean mash. This maximizes flavor... big time.</p>
<p>after plunger reaches the top of the cup, stop and press down to the 1.5 line. Then slowly pull the plunger back up, and add additional water. Continue doing this until you've used all the water in the Bonavita; ensuring that you keep the temp at 195 the whole time</p>
<p>Press till your cup is full; hopefully being able to run out of water and press all the way to the bottom. The last 5% the press can go down will pull extra oils out of the coffee beans (and believe me, with <a href="https://twitter.com/DeathWishCoffee" rel="nofollow">@DeathWishCoffee</a>
 you'll want the oils). And now, 1 last step (whhaaaa?)</p>
<a href="https://giphy.com/embed/tu54GM19sqJOw" rel="nofollow">https://giphy.com/embed/tu54GM19sqJOw</a>
<p>Get ANOTHER cup of similar size (or slightly larger), and slowly pour your full cup of coffee into this one until you hit about 95% empty. Very, slowly pour this last amount and you'll be able to trap any excessive sediment added via "the btopro method" and discard.</p>
<p>And now. You have the ultimate cup of home brewed coffee. Perfect for enjoying while the kids are napping and you write an excessively long series of tweets about how you typically spend 15 minutes making a cup of coffee much to the critique of everyone you know and love.
Fin.</p>

      <title>HAX apereo piece</title>
      <link>hax-apereo-piece-2</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>Once you see HAX, and realize how it works, you won't be able to unsee it. What is HAX? HAX is short for Headless Authoring eXperience; meaning that we've decoupled the authoring of content and media from any backend storage system. This frees us to build the best authoring solution for the web. Not specifically for ELMS:LN, or Sakai, or Tsugi but for the web in general. HAX does this through a front-end technology called web components. Web components have been in the pipeline of the web for many years, but the time is finally right to start jumping on board and planning for how to use them in the future. Web components in short are a four part specification already in most browsers fully (or polyfill-ed in) which allows for the creation of new, custom html tags that the browser recognizes. This nets you modular / component driven development without the need for bloated frameworks like Angular, React, etc. HAX leverages this technology to build a form of web components authoring web components. This means that we can build new custom elements that any browser understands, and have it fire up a single JSON object and IF hax is around it will understand how to build a UI for it. HAX based content will never appear to have been made with HAX, because it's just writing data into web component properties the same way any developer could. This means faculty can start authoring advanced HTML without ever looking at it. It also means we as developers can build and expand our systems using open standards without frameworks limiting who can plug and play where. The #usetheplatform movement is lively and is ultimately the replacement for all frameworks or at least huge chunks of them while allowing us to share visual and functional assets. Interested in helping us #haxtheweb? Check out some links: * [http://haxtheweb.org](http://haxtheweb.org) - this is a demo which is completely headless * [https://github.com/LRNWebComponents](https://github.com/LRNWebComponents) - our open element library, currently north of 130 elements that work anywhere * [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJQupiji7J5eTqv8JFiW8SZpSeKouZACH](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJQupiji7J5eTqv8JFiW8SZpSeKouZACH) - #haxtheweb playlist of tutorials, demonstrations, and ramblings This is an effort that can benefit any Apereo project and the ELMS:LN core team would happily entertain collaborations to help bring HAX to more than just ELMS:LN's community. Currently there are HAX integrations for Drupal (6,7), BackdropCMS, GravCMS and ELMS:LN. HAX is slated to be the default authoring experience for ELMS:LN by Fall 2018 with pilot to real people happening Summer 2018. *[this piece was originally written for the Apereo newsletter](https://www.apereo.org/)</p>

      <title>The Knowledge Decentralization Manifesto</title>
      <link>the-knowledge-decentralization-manifesto-2</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p class="highlight"><span class="dropcaps dropcaps-a">A</span>ccess to knowledge is a control system.</p>
<p>As the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_fruit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">Apple of Eden</a>
" unlocked the power to question so too is the case with all modern knowledge transfer technologies. Knowledge corrupts established thought, expands horizons, and changes human outcomes in powerful ways. It has network effects of its own and so, it is imperative that we as producers and orchestrators of knowledge production, management and dissemination acknowledge the power we wield. We have the power to shape society. So how best can we utilize our talents to maximize empowerment?</p>
<p><em>It is an ethical imperative that we seek the fundamental transformation of higher education to maximize quality and access to knowledge</em>
. This transformation will empower the globe to increase empathy, maximize personal freedom and personal growth through increased educational equality.</p>
<h2>Change knowledge dissemination; change everything.</h2>
<p>We will build a more open, more accessible, more equal opportunities, and as a result a more just society through the empowerment of all regardless of background, experience, status or financial means. What structural problems must we attack in order to fundamentally alter the dissemination and production of knowledge? What philosophy of system design can we adopt in order to change structural inequality?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actorânetwork_theory" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">Actor network theory</a>
 offers a critical lens with which to view production and implementation of knowledge dissemination technologies. TLDR; all machines and human connections influence one another equally and their relative positioning to one another is important. Simply using a tool is not enough, the tool must provide affordances that eliminate structural inequality in knowledge production and dissemination.</p>
<p>To illustrate that there is a difference in possibilities through knowledge dissemination usage</p>
<figure class="image"><figcaption>A, B contrasting knowledge dissemination and learning environment management</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All knowledge is produced by accessing website X. All knowledge seekers access website X.
A counter to this approach is similar in initial access but maximizes flexibility and potential quality of experience
All knowledge is produced in any location that best meets its needs (Solution Y), then referenced in website X. All knowledge seekers access website X, but are pushed out to website Y.</p>
<h2>Decentralization of knowledge construction</h2>
<p>This decentralization of knowledge construction still affords the minimal amount of centralization required to avoid chaos, which I shall deem <a href="https://btopro.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/structured-anarchy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">structured anarchy</a>
. The point of decentralizing knowledge production is not to produce chaos, it is to provide more vibrant, local options to better meet the needs of knowledge producers based on the topic of choice. We don't setup science lab classes expecting to teach forestry in them. We don't expect our doctors of tomorrow to learn while dangling from a tree harness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why then should it be absurd to construct technology environments that best meet the needs of the topic at hand?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Seeding this ground, that all learning environments and knowledge production silos are the same, forces us to accept structural failings of today's learning management systems which better resemble a theocracy then today's vibrant internet culture. These structural failures lead to simple technical ones that are difficult for modern knowledge produces to understand (yet are forced to accept)</p>
<figure class="image"><img alt="A typical cycle produced by lack of empowerment" src="/images/a/8/3/1/f/a831fce14cbe3278c7b745d4be271d51101052b4-the-last-30-years-of-knowledge-dissemination.jpeg"/><figcaption>A typical cycle produced by lack of empowerment</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>Want to improve engagement with learners and knowledge seekers? No, the theocracy doesn't allow JavaScript.</li>

<li>Want to improve perception of knowledge quality through design? No, the theocracy demands understanding of complex technical underpinnings.</li>

<li>Want to reference or pull in external knowledge? Yes, but only if it follows our ridged, dated orthodoxies of API design.</li>

</ul>
<h2>There's another way out.</h2>
<p>A phrase has emerged (circa 2014) to attempt to encompass the antithesis of the theocratic knowledge production market. <a href="https://library.educause.edu/resources/2014/9/next-generation-digital-learning-environment-initiative" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">Next Generation Digital Learning Environments (NGDLE)</a>
 is thought of as the response to legacy theocratic knowledge dissemination technologies. NGDLE embraces knowledge construction by leveraging a free and open internet as well as the construction of new learning ecosystems. It seeks maximal freedom for knowledge producers to utilize whatever methods of production they can access in order to best disseminate knowledge to those seeking it.</p>
<p>The theocratic knowledge production market has attempted to utilize existing methods of structural inequality in order to perpetuate their control in the name of next generation. It utilizes legacy standards like Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) in order to claim that it has embraced the internet by providing a window out to it.</p>
<p></p>
<figure class="image"><img alt="Visualizing LTI Entrapment" src="/images/4/f/8/e/d/4f8ede8b429c64be36876f9e5103415bcc806f7a-lti-entrapment.jpeg"/><figcaption>Visualizing LTI Entrapment</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>
<p>"Look at us, we've changed. No really, we have. We <em>allow you</em>
 to access (some) additional methods of construction. Just stay with us, please, we've changed." the theocratic knowledge production market says. Like an abusive lover though, it hasn't actually changed, it's just gotten a haircut and bought flowers (or, you know, adopted Twitter's bootstrap framework and claimed the high ground of usability as a result).</p>
<p></p>
<figure class="image"><img alt="Theocratic knowledge production market where it really is, where it claims, and then where NGDLE and my projects attempt to take society" src="/images/7/f/3/0/0/7f300005440f74a78d82542a2e3c3f0bb56dd8c2-innovation-in-course-infrastructure.jpeg"/><figcaption>Theocratic knowledge production market where it really is, where it claims, and then where NGDLE and my projects attempt to take society</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>
<p>The knowledge production theocracy wants you; needs you; no, demands that you stay in a stasis.</p>
<h2>But you donât need them</h2>
<p>NGDLE is not about building up a long dead, one sided relationship (and ideology). It's an approach that says we need to tell the LMS that "we're cool, we've moved on. We can still be friends though". I mean, LMS still has all your CDs in its car and you can't just leave 40 or 50 CDs in LMS's car right? No, don't abandon your CDs in LMS's car; I'm saying though that we need to consider how we can make LMS useful the best self it can be too. The LMS was never meant to do too much, but we previously demanded that it do so. Like every Disney villain, they aren't purely evil, the theocratic knowledge production market is just misguided. It's going where capitalism has allowed it to go and needs a purely decentralized, internet mindset in order to right the (sinking) ship.</p>
<p>NGDLE more than technology construction is about aligning the foundational principle of academic freedom with technology freedom. While the theocratic knowledge production market provides and enforces bland experience construction; NGDLE by contrast fosters personal growth, seeking new idea and expanding horizons through the intentional decentralization of knowledge production and dissemination.</p>
<p></p>
<figure class="image"><img alt="A network of solutions across the wider internet" src="/images/e/2/a/e/8/e2ae8d1aa89d07c58512dca2372ab8dcc6ddfa9b-knowledge-producer.jpeg"/><figcaption>A network of solutions across the wider internet</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>
<p>This is why NGDLE has been so difficult for anyone to embrace (or build for that matter...ELMS:LN is 4 years old and only now is making sense in discussions I have or slides). NGDLE is not a product. It is a mindset, a method of knowledge assembly that ensures no centralized authority can exist. Without centralization, it's very difficult for the theocratic knowledge production market (as it presently exists) to make money. And if it's purely profit driven (spoiler alert: they don't care about you no matter how big their conference, they want your money).</p>
<h2>Bringing the market to succumb to NGDLE</h2>
<p>If the market existed, then capitalism alone would provide it right? We've been asking for these products and the theocratic knowledge production market provided. To which I'd retort... when Toys R Us existed and we all went to a centralized location to buy toys, did we sit around and think "huh, there's gotta be a way we can get rid of this process and provide better outcomes". I mean, the market produced a solution to a need, we utilized it, so it was clearly the best (I mean they had a run for 70+ years<span style="font-size: 1em;">).</span></p>
<p>Some will argue the market caught up with them (Amazon specifically) but what really happened? Amazon embraced a decentralized access methodology, aka internet centric access and development method. By increasing pressure in the server and supply chain automation space they were able to collapse the theocratic toy purchase market.</p>
<h2>Forces to support which will decentralize the theocratic knowledge production market</h2>
<p>Support these efforts, and we collectively can disrupt the theocratic knowledge production market</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://paulhibbitts.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">Paul Hibbits Course Hub GravCMS project</a>
</li>

<li><a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/domain-of-ones-own/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">Reclaim hosting - Domain of One's Own</a>
</li>

<li><a href="https://www.tsugi.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">Tsugi</a>
</li>

</ul>
<p>Stand up for voices that are attacking the theocratic knowledge production market and are using their money and their feet to demonstrate their commitment to ending it. Paul's work illustrates the power of the individual to get up and leave and not fail. Reclaim hosting is an example of how an edge industry and further erode confidence in the theocratic knowledge production market. Tsugi is a representation of how we can micro service the theocratic knowledge production market into a position where you start questioning why you have an LMS. I will say that as I'm far more aggressive in my NGDLE stance then Dr. Chuck, his technology embraces the theocratic knowledge production market too much and will ensure that it always exists.</p>
<p>I am a hardline NGDLE believer. I am change. I am a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tempered-Radicals-People-Difference-Inspire/dp/0875849059" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">Tempored Radical</a>
. As a result, the fronts that I push on and will continue to push on are far more decentralized then these approaches. All three of the above empower people... to continue to use the theocratic knowledge production market over the long term. They build up their users for sure, but in any social declaration of where we can go, someone needs to try and be the goal post.</p>

<p>These represent my own efforts to bring about the decentralization of knowledge production in order to Transform Education.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://haxtheweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">#HAXtheweb</a>
 - Decentralized, OER Schema aware knowledge construction platform. Run an identical authoring experience regardless of platform and leverage the web as a whole. Work on a desktop, a phone, locally, in a CMS, in an LMS? Doesn't matter. HAX is intended to be a decentralized production system which makes writing complex HTML trivial. It's also engineered to allow developers to extend the authoring experience by simply extending the web (through web component based architecture, ala LRN Web components below).</li>

<li><a href="https://www.elmsln.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">ELMS:LN</a>
 - ELMS: Learning Network - A system of systems, built with NGDLE in mind. It is engineered to power HAX (and HAX power it). It provides methods for environment construction so that educators can have more vibrant learning ecosystems rather then single widget-y + 1 tools. ELMS:LN pulls all of these technologies and grows in capabilities as elements make it possible. It is both experiment and development platform for testing new pedagogical idea as they relate to design as well as delivering higher quality experiences then traditional LMS can produce.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/author/LRNWebComponents" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">LRN Web components</a>
 - LRN Web Components is an ever expanding design and functionality component set that powers ELMS:LN, HAX and any system that we develop. It allows for an insane amount of reuse across educational projects and is intended to solve the NGDLE problem of cognitive load on learners via design and development consistency making environments easier to use and develop.</li>

<li><a href="http://oerschema.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">OER Schema</a>
 - Schema for expressing pedagogy. It extends Schema.org and provides semantic meaning to all of the elements produced as part of LRN Web Components, meaning that every system (edtech or otherwise) that implement LRN Web Components will be getting wired for OER Schema. This will provide a more vibrant search and remix experience for OER content produced over the long haul of society.</li>

</ul>

<h2>I'll see you in the future.</h2>
<p>We can develop in minutes what takes the establishment months to envision. When we give these technologies away. When we work with faculty person to person to empower them not to stand on our shoulders but to stand on their own, completely independent of us (via HAX). There is no limit to what we can do when we start working together.</p>
<p>I will be told that I'm full of myself, and often have, and that's fine. But if Hawkings felt he couldn't be better than Einstein he never would have tried. If it wasn't an active journey to be the best, to liberate the most, . I can pledge to you now, whoever you are, that you have a critical role to play in the future development of educational technology solutions and helping improve structural inequality, if you want to.</p>
<p>I'm standing up, and I won't back down from these ideas, technologies, and approaches. My heroes are probably a little different than yours. My heroes are people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Salk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">Jonas Salk</a>
, inventor of the Polio vaccine that refused to patton it. Like <a href="http://www.dr-chuck.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">Dr. Charles R. Severance</a>
 who's crazy enough to believe in a communication's protocol so deeply that he'd get tattoos of those that implemented it (as an LTI founder and me viewing LTI as evil, we're a fun party pack). Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">Richard Stallman</a>
 who is unapologetic in his adherence to open source and free software. And all those that donate their time and efforts in order to empower others to build solutions for themselves.</p>
<p>I've passed up money, promotions, companies, consulting, time with loved ones (the big picture is a better future for my boys); because of an idea which I know to be true: any individual can change the world. I will change whatever educational equity issue I can resolve in my life time, or will at least work as hard as I can towards attempting to resolve those issues. I've been blessed with an amazing opportunity in this world... to write code that I can release in hopes of making an impact. I know that if you'd join us and do the same, that we can improve access, increase quality, and eliminate the need for anyone to be dependent on anyone else to disseminate knowledge.</p>
<p>Will you join me in trying to be more than just a vapor in this world but to leave a legacy as the people that stood up and caused a social movement that saw a dramatic improvement in education and knowledge production systems? Through better solutions, people will be able to better empathize with one another, have a bigger world view, and reduce real world conflicts. Through better solutions we'll get knowledge out to people in faraway places and disadvantaged nearby ones that build people up and teach them how to fish on their own. That give them untold experiences without the need to take on hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt.</p>
<p>Ex Uno Plura - Out of one, many. Be that one that can bring forth the empowerment of many.</p>

      <title>Playing for 40</title>
      <link>playing-for-40-2</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>A former student employee reached out to me today and, as I've always dreamed of having the experience of a reach teacher, paid me a compliment in the form of successes he now can achieve through imparted knowledge.
> ..thank you for teaching me more about being a developer than my degree did
Now, the compliment wasn't meant as a swipe at his education, meerly that "on the job" training was more impactful. As we talked, things came to money and endevours he was undertaking which didn't pay anything currently but gave him something to keep busy.
I've been thinking about writing for awhile and so my response to him (more or less) is what follows. It's less a reponse for him then it is for you, whoever you are. Many, many years ago I went on a rant about getting off the bench and into the game; And the concept keeps coming back to me as I see the view from 2017 looking back on btopro in 2012 when I wrote that. Oh Bryan, if only I could have told you how the next 5 years would play out.
I felt it important in talks, blogging, social media, to always reference that this was my life. That I wasn't going away (at least of my own doing) as a way of trying to solidify my commitments to you, the future of education or those currently engaged in it, that these ideas will not dissipate. I will not bow to the monsters of edtech.
Today, I write to these ends as a means of illustrating the next 5 years. Where I see us going, and how bright the future is.</p>

Dr. Jonas Salk</h2>
<p>So this is written before it's written about me.
</p>
<p>I'm not here for fame.</p>
<p>I'm not here for treasure.</p>
<p>I'm not here for ego.</p>
<p>I'm not here for "work-life balance".</p>
<p>I'm not here for traditional advancement.</p>
<p>I'm here to solve problems using the God given talents and fortunate circumstances I find myself in. I recognition, appreciate, and seek to pursue the fullness of the oppurtunity I have before me. It comes to simple truths.</p>
<p>I <strong>know</strong>
 <em>we</em>
 will change the world. In the last year, ELMS:LN has grown from two people with lines to contributing to the platform to five, internally. Externally there is also a developer at another organization with another one starting soon and <strong>multiple contributions coming from random individuals across the globe</strong>
.</p>
<p>I'm here to be like Dr. Jonas Salk, a hero of mine, who when asked who owned the patent on the cure said:</p>

"playing for 40"</h2>
<p>> You see every day, every week and every year of my life I'm always 10 years away from being my hero - <a href="https://youtu.be/wD2cVhC-63I?t=3m11s" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/wD2cVhC-63I?t=3m11s</a>

Knowing our history, seeing where we're heading and what is soon to come.. I feel it important to share the phrase I've been focusing on to keep myself grounded. I keep telling people I'm "playing for 40". This is definitely a departure in mindset from me 5 years ago who would claim a stake in the ground for success based on today. No. I'm behaving as if we're only half way there...and I always will.
I love that clip from the video above; I'm always 10 years away from being my hero. Right now, one of my hero's is me at 40. Now, for context, that's 6.5 years away (oi i'm getting old). But it's true. I'm not focusing on today, I'm focusing on where I see us heading in the next 6.5 years as a community and thinking about how we get to that spot.
Right now, ELMS as a project idea is 10 years old. The Learning Network that we breathe is currently ~4 years old. So if we're only 1/2 way to wher I envision us being... what does that look like? Who do we want to be when we grow up?</p>

Dreaming reality</h2>
<p>Feb 18th, 2024:
Get every university on earth to have a level, technical playing field. Ideas should be the drivers of the future, not who's knowledge economy is more built up or financial situation better. Level the technical playing field, start to level other inequalities and disparities in education.
Try to impact every possible learner within or without institutions. Both through formal adoption as well as empowering those with knowledge and information to freely produce, disseminate and mentor with those who are in need of that knowledge.
I believe that through free solutions that work every and anywhere, we can transform education and through transformation of education we can create a better, more perfect society.</p>

</a>
How do we get there?</h2>
<p>Together. It is a small part of a much more complex ecosystem (society), but I believe that by creating the highest quality authoring and learner experiences imaginable and requiring those toolsets be open source that we can do our small part in making that dream a reality.</p>

          <![CDATA[ <p>I'd like to put a positive spin on Millennials / Gen Y. As someone who doesn't really feel like he's a Millennial (until reading that most quantify this between 1980 and 2000), I often would read articles about Gen Y and come to a similar conclusion: Lazy, entitled, bored, unmotivated.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hER0Qp6QJNU" rel="nofollow">Simon Sinek on Millennials</a>

I enjoy his positive spin on the "Millennial problem", that they (well.. we) find ourself coming into work contexts that we don't believe in. I'd like to expand out of just the positive things about Millennials and what we seek into a single word that I've started to hear to describe my own speaking style.</p>

"How do you get away with that?"</h2>
<p>I've been told since about the 2nd year in the working world (10 years into same career as of this writing) that I can seemingly say anything without retribution. Now obviously this isn't true; but there does seem to be a feeling at times that I'm able to say what people are thinking or address problems directly without emotion or concern for what the consequence.
This may manifest in simple ways such as challenging the status quo or looking at a problem differently then the team is attacking it and not being affraid to say so. At other times this manifests as dropping the F word in meetings to emphasize how much I disagree with a current direction (not angrily, just to emphacize that we need to consider this seriously).
So how is this possible? How do I have so many great friends and enemies (probably way more in this column for those that don't get me). It's because of a single word that I think we desperately lack in the world. It's because I'm <em>Genuine</em>
.</p>

Gen Uine</h2>
<p>What does Generation Y stand for? Beats me, but I will say that I've noticed we are largely attracted to anything that is genuine. Society is marketing, image management, social studies, over produced vocals, and politicians that run on words like Hope and making things Great; yet still perpetuate the same levels of corruption as previous generations.
We stop going to churches that speak yet don't provide action or community (for refernece I have a church I love and it's because of action and community). We stop watching things that are heavily produced in favor of organic expression online (I'm a cord cutter). We stop paying attention to anything that we don't believe in (I'm not apathetic, I just know what I can/'t influence and focus). We crave genuine discussion and see it avoided in much of the social sphere in favor of arguments from talking points memos fed to mouth pieces for/against whatever the topic (this is why I'm often misidentified as both Liberal and Conservative because I follow logic and truth, not ideological purity).
Be, Genuine. Gen Uine is what I'd much rather be known as then a Millennial or Gen Y or even Bryan Ollendyke or btopro. I don't care if you like me, but I never want you to doubt where I stand on a subject. That's Gen Uine; that's "raw" that's real that's what we desperately lack in society and need to embrace if we're ever to fix the problems we face.
How? Stop worrying about what other people think. Seek out facts, challenge bias. Speak up; for yourself and others. Don't follow the crowd and always question why a group feels the way it does and why you feel that way before joining a group.</p>

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p class="highlight"><span class="dropcaps dropcaps-i">I</span> saw this picture at Disney's Test Track ride and had to take a picture. I love that the build up to this ride they have lots of (propaganda) pictures, prototypes and interviews with people about cars. What cars mean to them, what they represent in American culture, what they're experiences were with cars and why these designers got passionate about creating designs for new cars.</p>
<p>While this is what Disney does to pass the time while waiting in a multiple hour line, this one stood out to me because while a Chevy commercial from start to finish, it was at least a cool and inspiring Chevy commercial. These four words had little descriptive signs to go with them early on in the ride (aka start of the line) which talked about the components to any new car or idea that they would come up with. I like these four concepts for buildingÂ something new and wanted to bring them to our edTech world we build.</p>
<h2>Line</h2>
<p>Designers start with an idea.Â  We get an idea from anywhere, maybe something we saw we liked or something we're reacting to that we didn't. No matter what the idea though it starts with jotting it down. Taking notes, reflecting (with lots of coffee and music) about what we could build. Writing and drawing are the first phase to bringing something new into existence.</p>
<h2>Clay</h2>
<p>Then it's time to prototype the idea. We have to take it from sketches and, again with lots of coffee and music, bring that idea to reality on a screen. Maybe it's not the finished product, but it's enough of a sculpting of future reality that we can bring our vision to life in the eyes of someone attune to what we are expressing. The clay phase isn't finalized but it at least is semi-functional and allows us to get confirmation (or rejection) of the premise we're building against so that we can form it more fully later.</p>
<h2>Math</h2>
<p>Next after refinement as a block of clay it's time to take the idea and ensure it fits with the laws of physics. In edTech, our "laws of physics" is often constraints of delivering media on the web. Package size, dependencies on other existing things, extending our universe of tools to be as robust as possible without bloating it. Beyond this, our laws extend into actual laws like needing to account for accessibility and universal design.</p>
<h2>Emotion</h2>
<p>Passion for the car and what your building. We certainly align here and this word was really what lead me to want to write it down. If you don't have passion for what you're building, then you need to find some place that does bring you that satisfaction in life. We bring an undying passion to our work, knowing the creations we build are used to impact the minds of thousands. It's not easy designing future systems, especially not politically, but keeping in mind who we're here to serve makes it all worth it.</p>
<p>You can see emotion in what I write, I'm told it's visible in what I say in presentations too (though that's usually the coffee + coffee + music doing that). I've been told lately it's infectious and that's really good to hear; cause several years ago @btopro wasn't as well received or appreciated for enthusiasm.Â  When your outside the <a innertext="Overton window" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window" title="Overton window political theory" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">Overton window</a>

, people will reject what your saying. If you really do believe in what you're preaching, then it's on you not to try and change them (or you) but to change the way you message what you believe.</p>
<p>Simple language changes can trigger a reaction of "wow I see it that way now" instead of "what are you pushing now?". Don't give up. Organizations want to remain at rest unless acted upon by an unstoppable force. Be that force of change in whatever you aspire to do.</p>

      <title>Efficiency as Activism</title>
      <link>efficiency-as-activism-2</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p class="highlight"><span class="dropcaps dropcaps-e">E</span>fficiency is not just the right thing to do or the act of making things better then before. Like anything, it can be a tactic if used correctly to modify structures from within. Anything done with intention is activism and so,Â If you don't like someone, automate them.</p>
<h3>Huh?</h3>
<p>Automate them. Do your job in 90% of the time it takes to do, use the other 10% to study and analyze their process. What is it they do? How do they make money? Now, start to carve around that person via process modification. You can intentionally disrupt their job, all the while claiming it in the name of efficiency.</p>
<h3>That's evil</h3>
<p>Yeah, kind of; but not in any way different then what happens when corporations (now called Start-Ups because it's less evil sounding) intentionally enter a space in a different way to "Disrupt" a marketplace. Efficiency is generally viewed as a social good and a net positive but it destroys ways of doing business and the humans attached to those hierarchies. Can you imagine what it must be like to have been a telephone operator and see them wheel in a machine that automatically did routing, putting 1000s out of work?</p>
<p>So, for those of you out there with root access to things; what will you do with these powers? What can you make the machine do that you cannot yet producing the same net effect? What percentage of your job can you automate in order to do other things to produce Magic?</p>
<h3>Magic?</h3>
<p>Yeah, Magic. That which we can't comprehend is indiscernible from Magic -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">Clarke's three laws</a>
. I got asked this weekend when I realized I could automate and no one would notice what i was doing. I looked up and way... thought... and said... 6 years ago. I've been able to automate for about 6 years, and I have. It's why what we're doing doesn't seem believable, because I've been working on the scaffolding of what it is we're standing on today, 3 years ago. I intentionally, painfully so at times, focused on under the hood automation rather then front-facing usability. Because you can always make people like the way something looks, you can never change what it's built on top of (or at least not easily).</p>
<p>And so, when I say we can pick up and give you every innovation our group has made and let you produce new ones; and do so with exponentially increasing accuracy, capability, ease of use and ease of setup. I'm not lying, we're just making Magic, through efficiency, done so to empower others to produce innovations of their own. Ultimately seeking to boil self-empowerment down to choice. Do you copy and paste the line and liberate yourself and others? Do you help others toÂ disrobe these cloaks,Â so invisibly <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;">placed</span>Â upon creativity or do we continue onward without direct control of educational experiences?</p>
<h3>What is my activist intentionÂ you may ask?</h3>
<p>Empowerment. More importantly, what's yours?Â Who will you automate today?</p>

      <title>Transforming industry through information altruism</title>
      <link>transforming-industry-through-information-altruism-2</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <full-width-image source="files/89cd7f14f2e207bd9a20b916cddc089da4ba3464-butterfly.jpg" caption="Transform" style="width: 50%;"></full-width-image>
<p>This posting is a refinement of a concept that I presented earlier: <i>Using OSS to disrupt industries.</i>
</p>
<p>Through the title, I am suggesting that there are negative network-effects in the form of social impact with open source systems. Â In fact, I'll go so far to say that open source software can be used to collapse entire markets, both IT and non-IT. Â Much like having access to capital allows you to invest in ventures that often times generate more capital (once rich it's easier to become super-rich), the more available source code is, the easier it is to free-up more and more source code.</p>
<p>It also can cause closed-source projects to collapse (or at least their market to reduce) as more and more adopt open practices. Â An unfortunate fact though is that information walling often results in more jobs. Â The more hops information has to take, the more jobs were created to get there. Â How many people got put out of jobs because automation happened in the phone switch industry? Â I believe the same thing will soon be happening to those in the open source industry as the industry turns inward and puts itself out of work. Â First it'll be some projects taking each other out of the next few years thanks to market forces but at least in the Drupal community, I'm already seeing cracks.</p>
<p>People at the top asking for more and more control over the platform, even though it's the very thing that they went to open source to get away from. Â Here are some other examples I could come up with of where giving away code has far greater consequences then just giving code away.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h3>Digital altruism collapsing digital form</h3>
<p>Open source is an iterative process which leads to the open sourcing of more technologies that enable more people to do more with less technical knowledge. Â Apache leads to PHP / MySQL leads to Wordpress / Drupal systems. Â As a result, I've seen Dreamweaver (as an example) go from a tool that I used to build websites to a tool that I use to build code to allow others to build websites. Â This is the creative and destructive power of open source.</p>
<h3>Digital altruism collapsing digital form and physical form</h3>
<p>This doesn't have to just be contained to software platforms though. Â Wikipedia, leads to freer access to information, leads to marginalization of paid information sources (books, Encarta, etc) which collapses the previousÂ silo-ing of knowledge in sources that had a cost of entry.</p>
<h3>Digital Altruism collapsing the IT industry</h3>
<p>Previous web-development shops had coders, site layout and design, producers, copy editors, graphic artists, server manager, all with different talents and skills. Â Now with the web landscape being as it is, the cost of entry has been lowered forÂ everyone. Â As such, I don't need to know layout / design because of captured, open knowledge, in the form themes / templates. Â I don't need copy editors (or as many) because everyone can self-moderate content as well as use small publishing workflows to release content. Â Server management consoles exist and captured knowledge in the form of things like MAMP and XAMPP (not to mention open source based services like wordpress.com) make it easy to get a site up and off the ground. Â Come to think of it, I don't even need me, the coder, because other coders have captured install and configuration knowledge in the CMS like wordpress.com.</p>
<p>No, the only person "needed" to produce a high quality website with new content is the content author and maybe a manager (though those could be the same person).</p>
<p>What's the trend I'm seeing currently? Â We're going from a world where there are less hubs and less authorities. Â Where information can be created and disseminated so quickly that newspapers and traditional TV media aren't going away entirely, but are definitely being softened in tone. Â If I want an opinion I can go anywhere and get it and that's great (most people already know this).</p>
<p>But what I also see happening, is that we're collapsing our own industry. Â I see less and less people wanting to get into the IT sector because those that have come before them have made things so easy, so wyziwig'ed, so fast that it's not interesting to them. Â This will lead to less ideas, less choice, and only a few technical authorities who can effectively kick the door shut on all those who come after them. Â A truly, Apple (and a few others) world of elite companies as well as a few elite open source advocates along for the ride.</p>
<p>Connect the dots, speak out for more choice, question why someone is giving you something for free ;).</p>

      <title>Transform Control</title>
      <link>transform-control-2</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <full-width-image source="files/2cbcf74eb414cbc4ffc644bc923c33a3b5e3be26-sandbagged.jpg" caption="Control" style="width: 50%;"></full-width-image>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The old addage of IT managers of the 90's was that technology didn't matter. As in, it didn't matter which technology you choose, just that you align with one and execute. This mindset was wrought with good intentions;Â solutions and peopleÂ should matter, notÂ howÂ you get there. This was true in the days prior to frameworks, when languages were all we had.</p>
<p>Now, very few people build anything from scratch (of any scale). They always use frameworks, whether CMS frameworks like Drupal or Wordpress, or system scaffolding frameworks like Symfony or Zend. Frameworks made technology selection matter. Why build in a year what youÂ can produce 90% of in a minute. The only argument would be bloat of codebase and if the framework gave you the flexibility andÂ <strong>control</strong>
Â required. (Google's building quantum computers so... "Bloat" is a temporal construct)</p>
<p>Then came the deployment argument. Do we do it internally where we canÂ <strong>control</strong>
Â access to the servers and know where the data lives? Or, are we comfortable with giving up thatÂ <strong>control</strong>
Â in favor of flexibility by going toÂ theÂ cloud. The flexibility andÂ <strong>control</strong>
Â argument plays out in society at large all the time; but, I view technology as coming to a tipping point thanks to automated deployments, frameworks, and the future whereÂ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">humans need not apply.</a>
</p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin and the block chain will be the design methodology that shatters IT structures.Â We simply don't need human conceptions of structure dictating theÂ <strong>control</strong>
Â of information. Technology, and the future of humanity, is distributed, framework driven and managed by robots and automated deployment mechanisms. We no longer need humanÂ <strong>control</strong>
Â structures to dictate who has access to what. Rather, human hierarchies (and too many of them) disempower through the distribution of decision making. Corporations do this all the time. BP spill, who do we blaim? eh, no one, it's a corporation. A named, yet faceless entity that controls oil flowing from the ground yet is unaccountableÂ (weird huh?).</p>
<h2>Where is innovation?</h2>
<p>So what is empowerment if the hierarchy of humanity is no longer needed in order to achieve it? We always hear about those mythical beings working in a garage with nothing but a computer and an idea. Why did it work? Why was the individual so transformative when all the structures of the day were not? Why is it that innovation lives in the garage but not in the boardroom?</p>
<p>Innovation is born of chaos and random chance... seemingly. It is a spark of imagination from the individual. The euphoria of bringing a new idea to life. In the unknown; that which weÂ <a href="http://github.com/elmsln/dig" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">DIG</a>
Â up and bring to life. And so, it is not simply enough to create a product that contains the innovations and ideas of the individuals that produced them. We must empower, through frameworks that allow such a thing, and harness these once chaotic conceptions into sustainable realities. Provide the thing thatÂ <strong>control</strong>
Â often claims to have the high ground on, sustainability through framework and automation.</p>
<h2>The revolution will be decentralized</h2>
<p>If the last 20 years of Silco projects have been about transfering power and wealth to a new power structure, the next revolution will be in transformation. It's not going to just be about improved consumer outcomes (cost, speed, access) and transfering wealth from one generation's VCs to the next. If we are to truely build a better society, we must seek to collapse structures, not simply build different ones that drive towards the same financial end.</p>
<p>And so here we work, building an army of innovators by breaking the chains of technology that keep ideas from reality and stamped out in boardrooms and support forums. Welcome to the revolution, where authors give away their views on technology and its ability to transform society. We are here to change the notionÂ ofÂ <strong>control</strong>
Â by empowering everyone to be inÂ <strong>control</strong>
Â of their own destiny.</p>

      <title>Legacy of Human Hierarchy</title>
      <link>legacy-of-human-hierarchy-2</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <full-width-image source="files/037e9f1490d0606b7967973e65ebefb1dbb333ee-file0001605429169.jpg" caption="Legacy" style="width: 50%;"></full-width-image>
<p class="highlight"><span class="dropcaps dropcaps-t">T</span>he hierarchy of humanity is changing.</p>
<p>Sorry, let me rephrase.. The hierarchy of humanityÂ <strong>must</strong>
Â change in order to survive and remain relevant. Because the way in which we've accessed information has changed, we no longer require authority to do anything from anyone.... as far as data-flows. See humans, we love hierarchy. Hierarchy dictates who gets access to what, who knows what, who can talk about who, who makes more money, where ideas stem from. All great, amazing... historical constructs.</p>
<p>If we are to truly make the world a better place, we need start looking towards new structures; the structure of technology.</p>
<h2>Deployment Hierarchy</h2>
<p>Deployment Hierarchies are flattening thanks to virtualization and containerization (and the two combined). We can now build virtual networks that live as clusters of containers within other containers (very meta). What the hell am I talking about?</p>
<h3>An example</h3>
<p>Say you want to run Salesforce, Yammer, Google Apps, Canvas LMS, Box.net, any application from a "SaaS" vendor (more like <strong>control</strong>
 broker).</p>
<p>The question I have for you... How many people do these companies hire when you send them your multi-million dollar contracts? What are their workflows? Do you really think you are paying for access to developers and their talents?</p>
<p>No, you're having someone in sales probably click a button, that kicks off you being a customer. This gets picked up by the DevOps team's scripting engine and automatically provisions a new container of the infrastructure, plugging in the tokenized values for things like "My University" and "Company Logo here". The future of SaaS based products is increasingly automated (so stop paying someone to do what you can automate yourself if you plan to exist 50 years from now).</p>
<h2>The legacy of human infrastructure</h2>
<p>But we've already hired hundreds of people. But we've already got people managing them in a pyramid shaped structure. Oh, so you think you're the only one? No, everyone still organizes this way in the old world constructed before the dawn of deployment architecture. Instead of giving up though, how can we reenvision ourselves and our organizations to remain competitive (aka exist) the next 10 year transition.</p>
<h2>Big Red Button</h2>
<p>If your organization had a Big Red Button (that was easy) of sorts that did all the work for you, who would you allow to push it? Can everyone push the button if it produced new ideas, new products, better outcomes? Or is the HPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion) the only one that matters, the only idea allowed to be pushed into production. When we've dissolved the legacy infrastructure of humanity we'll be able to allow anyone with any idea to empower the organization to win. If we don't, they'll leave.</p>
<p>We can group the parts of an organization into the three Es of social shift: <strong>Eliminate</strong>
, <strong>Evolve</strong>
, <strong>Emerge</strong>
.</p>
<h2>Eliminate</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Committees</strong>
 - "Group" consensusÂ that can't be met after a single meeting of a handful of people dictates that someone dictate the solution and path. Dissolve these immediately, people will be happier.</li>
<li><strong>Vacated positions</strong>
 - Force the structures underneath these positions to reorganize, flatten, and allow that transformation to allow business processes to evolve.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Evolve</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Business practices</strong>
 - Workflows in the human hierarchy were built around who knew what and could accomplish a task. The future deployment hierarchy empowers all members to push the big red button of change.</li>
<li><strong>Trust</strong>
 - If you can't trust someone to push the big red button of progress, they shouldn't be on the team. Opening up room for failure ensures we aren't denied success in the process. Safe is dead.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Emerge</h2>
<ul><li><strong>Pseudo structures</strong>
 - people across traditional organizational boundaries now operate as a crack team to solveÂ problems. Over enough time, the traditional structures can be largely dissolved as these new pseudo structures become the institutional fabric of an organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Organizations that don't align themselves with the properties of technology (<em>boundless</em>
, <em>connected</em>
, <em>structureless</em>
) and instead adhere to traditional properties of the human hierarchy (<em>bound</em>
, <em>separated</em>
, <em>vertically oriented</em>
) will surcome to those "competitors" who do transform.</p>

      <title>Organic Deployment Architecture</title>
      <link>organic-deployment-architecture-2</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <full-width-image source="files/3f7119c8ee0795b23c3ed754c7e48860e8ad8b98-organic.jpg" caption="Organic" style="width: 50%;"></full-width-image>
<h3>Decentralized deployment architecture</h3>
<p class="highlight"><span class="dropcaps dropcaps-a">A</span>ll deployments currently imply a central authority, whether a company or developer running some kind of master system with control over the rest of the network. This implies control structures which could align with the <a href="legacy-human-hierarchy">human hierarchy, a thing we've placed in legacy</a>


.</p>
<p>In order to subvert existing human hierarchies, we need technology that doesn't operate like humans do..well, not in their whole being. We need to look toÂ organic chemistry. A virus, an infection, something that can replicate itself and spread. Less the negative connotations of disease and more the biological process of cell replication.Â Yes, we'll still have to have central listings of some form. The internet has DNS, indicating where the distributed someÂ things are located (as does TOR). So we'll needÂ repositories of some kind in order to ensure the authenticity of the package (GitHub, rpm's and what not) but by intentionally creating an organic deployment methodology, we can avoid the emergence ofÂ <strong>control</strong>


.</p>
<p>Now it's not that order is a bad thing. Surely order has given rise to the great (and fading) civilizations that we find ourselves in today (whatever the day is, we'll make new ones if these constructs fail us). But nature can break through and change society where code wrapped in business logic cannot. We need to liberate and decentralize; so less twitter (distributed as it may be, it is the only broker of tweets) and more email (truly distributed throughout the world and without ownership on the standard).</p>
<h3>Â </h3>
<h3>Traditional Deployments (modern day)</h3>
<p></p>
<figure class="image" style="width: 100%;"><img alt="Products live in containers next to each other without knowledge of whos who." src="files/container.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: 236px; float: left; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px;"/><figcaption>Products live in containers next to each other without knowledge of whos who.</figcaption>


</figure>
<p></p>
<p>Modern deployments use <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">docker</a>


 or <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/nsx/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">some form of virtualization</a>


. They effectively take the ins and outs of an application, tokenize them, and then slap them up in "the cloud" (AWS... all of them). Once there, when you buy into a product, they basically are just making you a containerized instance on AWS and charging you overhead. SaaS works because you are lazy (we all are) and we like having the simplicity of someone else taking out our garbage rather then us having to haul it to the dump every week.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <em>this puts us in the passenger seat to innovation</em>


. By giving up the routine of the garbage, we're beholden to the collection and disposal patterns of the garbageÂ men. We don't need to worry ourselves with innovation, they'll ensure trash A gets to dump site B, now turn off your brain and start printing money on your existing workflows.</p>
<h3>Â </h3>
<h3>Grabbing control</h3>
<p>By taking control, we are taking on risk (in the short-term) in order to gain creative direction in the future. Perhaps we no longer want to shill garbage, perhaps we want to recycle methane off-gasing of shallowly dug dump sites while utilizing solar powered vehicles. We now have that level of creative control. But unlike this fictitious scenario, we don't have to worry ourselves with the mechanisms involved; it's technology, and containerized technology at that; We can do (and scale) anything.</p>
<p>Containerizing, and for this definition I'm using I mean <strong>using separate hardware per client</strong>


, is the way to increase innovation as well as reduce risk. We can keep existing systems in place with existing client bases while driving forward with new, innovative clients that have unique needs, without worry of corrupting the successes of yesteryear.</p>
<p>But what if we wanted to take containerization a step further. What if we containerized different aspects of existing clients, enabling us to innovate more rapidly even in existing client bases. But this must come at the expense of complexity and risk, right? Not if we start designing our deployments and products <em>like living things</em>


.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h3>Deploying an organic compound</h3>
<p></p>
<figure class="image"><img alt="Agency of websites" src="files/agency.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 277px; float: right; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px;"/><figcaption>Agency of websites</figcaption>


</figure>
<p></p>
<p>We need to start thinking of our applications and their deployment as living things. We aren't just creating something people see on the web, we're creating engagement, uniting people across barriers and putting them in front of the information they need to live better lives. These experiences with a technology produce, in effect, <em>agency</em>


.</p>
<p>While this is not an autonomous, living, thinking organism, it is the first step towards the evolution of more complex beings. Mapping the internet to evolutionary processes, we are describing at single celled organisms. They can't do much on their own, but they are alive and mostly just react to the stimuli they are prodded with in the world.</p>
<p>When we enter input, we get reaction, etc.</p>
<p>The fun thing about living systems though and thinking about their design as such is that single celled organisms don't remain that way for long. Interestingly though, as we move up through biology, complex structures are often formed of simpler patterns repeated thousands of times.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h3>Organically pattern deployments</h3>
<p>An <em>organically pattern deployment</em>


 is a system that has the capability to set it self up again. I'm not talking traditionalÂ </p>
<p></p>
<figure class="image"><img alt="Simple forms complex structures" src="files/complexlife.jpg" style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; width: 250px; height: 160px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px; float: right;"/><figcaption>Simple forms complex structures</figcaption>


</figure>
<p></p>
<p>containerization where there's a host of some kind that's doing the replication. I mean, a system that is able to set itself up, and then setup replicantsÂ of itself which are fully functioning duplicates. A deployment methodology that patterns itself more off natureÂ then our legacy human hierarchies.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">Cell division</a>


 is the biological phase when a cell grows or splits off. It is a functional replica after the initial cell structure has reached an apex through the consumption of resources. With plants;Â sunlight, water, minerals. In the case of system deployments this could be usage, users, and data.</p>
<p>After enough usage, users, and data have been accumulated in a single system, the system follows the natural biological process (because we are creating life) by which its time to grow. This could mean more servers, more RAM, more processors, more storage, etc. In the case of a deployment methodology though, this means that the system will imprint itself upon a new server.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h3>Replication</h3>
<p></p>
<figure class="image"><img alt="Creating Life" src="files/creatinglife.jpg" style="width: 397px; height: 769px; float: left; margin: 5px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;"/><figcaption>Creating Life</figcaption>


</figure>
<p></p>
<p>The git repo is instructions built in that suggest how to setup a new copy of itself. Once the new copy of itself has been established, the new cell can call home to the old and ask for additional instructions. This is where we start to mirror nature in creating complexity from organized simplicity. The new cell (Cell B) is told that it was created because we need to migrate aspects of Cell A were becoming overburdened. Maybe there's too many people using function X which can be split off into a dedicated function for Cell B. Cell A then transfers everything needed to accomplish function X onto Cell B.</p>
<p>Because it's nature and we're talking about small, replicated tasks over time, it is important to note that in the evolutionary process, <em>Cell B could handle all the tasks of Cell A</em>


 (technically). The point of the Division is to create a new, more complex organism that's able to delegate functions of the being more effectively. As Cell A and B expand in capabilities,Â users, data and overall usage; the process could be repeated, forming a new organism that's made up of the simpler parts.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h3>My work</h3>
<p>This is the direction we're taking ELMS learning network, the educational technology platform that I help drive. The system will be treated like a living thing. Through the replication of simple tasks (a system that sets itself up) and the instructions to set itself up again (its DNA)Â included in the repo, we can start to form fractal deployments of ELMSLN. <em>A fractal deployment could be a copy of ELMSLN that is actually several working together to form one cohesive suite of systems</em>


. Let's say there are 13Â systems in ELMSLN that are discrete functionality that use RESTful web-services to talk to each other. Then these could live on 13Â different servers since they are served from 13Â different domains already.<img alt="" src="files/snowflake.jpg" style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; width: 420px; height: 395px; margin: 5px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; float: right;"/></p>
<p>The organic fractal component to the ELMSLN architecture would then suggest that 13Â different copies of ELMSLN could be stitched together seamlessly to act as one system to its user-base. These systems would be stood up as Cell Division from the original deployment. Using SSH keys and having access to automated DNS reconfiguration we could have the Cell A deployment actually set the rest of the network up automatically. It could, in effect, mutate from a single celled organism into a more complex one. And because it knows how it set itself up, and the rest of itself knows how it set itself up (meta), we could put in place security procedures and mechanisms that have the network act proactively. We could start to program the single celled organism to perform increasingly more autonomous tasks, which then propagate to the rest of the parts of the organism to produce exponentially more autonomy.</p>

<p>At that point, we're no longer <em>just</em>


 creating software, <strong>we're creating life</strong>

          <![CDATA[ <p class="highlight"><span class="dropcaps dropcaps-a">A</span>re we witness to 1940s style crowd manipulation through propaganda without realizing it? Have you watched the news lately? Does it go by a single day without having a "Get social" or "#HotToday" kind of story about what people are talking about on social media? Is it really, we the people talking on social media or are these social spacing being controlled by media companies helping to shape the things "everyone" is talking about. A few things to consider with Twitter for example from a financial perspective:</p>
<ol><li>It is to twitter (and Facebook and the rest)'s advantage to NOT close dead accounts in order to justify to the board how many impressions messages can get</li>
<li>It is to twitter (and the rest)'s advantage to NOT stop hate / controversial speech, trolling, etc</li>
<li>It isn't that difficult to craft a twitter bot that searches against key words and constructs simple, hateful / inciting rhetoric messages</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not suggesting they are doing this, I'm suggesting it is in their best interest financially to continue allowing the pattern to exist. It may sound conspiratorial until you realize it's already been done before. Anyone rememberÂ <a href="http://www.thegloss.com/2014/11/03/beauty/alex-from-target-teenager-viral-internet-meme/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">#AlexFromTarget</a>
? You'll notice in that link there is no reference to what actually happened. This may have "gone viral" but there was a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/04/living/alex-from-target/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">marketing company claiming to beÂ pulling the strings</a>
 to prove that they can do things like this. That they can get a random person on the news and millions talking about something pointless isn't really harmful, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/08/darpa-social-networks-research-twitter-influence-studies" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="external-link no-image">but what could be is this</a>
 (and you know others are doing it too).</p>
<p>What's to say this isn't happening right now? I've been trolled by hate-bots before. Mozilla controversy? Say the word Mozilla. Drumpft? Say his name, get attacked instantly. The easiest way to stop this? Ignore those bots seeking to put you in their echo chamber of hate. It keeps you from hyping twitter (and the hate brigades) agendas and maybe, just maybe will make you have a better outlook on the world too.</p>
<p>Question everything.</p>
