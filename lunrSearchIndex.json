https:\/\/githubcom\/lrnwebcomponents\/sillyhaxgame\/blob\/master\/sillyhaxgamehtml#l156   in this methodology your element listens to events atbody ofdocument yet says \"whenhear this bindback to

language)\u00c2\u00a0https:\/\/githubcom\/lrnwebcomponents\/haxbody\/blob\/master\/haxbodyhtml#l288   so hax data flow goes like this: there's a variable\u00c2\u00a0\"store\" \/\u00c2\u00a0state manager (haxstore) which all changing of global properties needs to consistently flow through that write function (whichstore keeps itself as a global namespace so then all calls to writestorefrom that)store effectively writes itself which then triggers a call to fire a consistent event saying \"a property has changedhere's its value\" then everyone else that cares (like haxbody in this
