user experience design  was there to talk web components  block editors  of course #haxtheweb        conversation steered into advantages of web components over past technology solutions libraries a really good consolidation of a lot of my thoughts about web components their importance in building a more sustainable  open web  half way through turn to hax m left open to rant    (so do) d like to unpack a statement because realize that while did an ok job of explaining  d like to have written down if end sup coming up  said something intentionally controversial because if don t challenge those with power  regardless of their intention  then left accepting powerlessness as a feature instead of bug that  quote takes place at 44:41 remaining in show  please subscribe to  rate review their podcast         wanted to link to audio here in context in case wanted to listen to while reading why feel this way     see gutenberg as a direct existential threat         to open web [and oer]  so this critique not of people who work on gutenberg  a deeper philosophical question of trust control in open source open web  when say do trust matt  don t mean as a person  mean do trust one person with control of your entire ux  forever  s a fair comparison to say same could be lodged at me in designing hax; yes aware other people have worked on gutenberg (and hax has more then just me on   )  my primary criticisms grouped: sustainability react flavor of this five year segment of time re coming up on its end  being from drupal saw core developers jump on javascript trains that had already fallen out of favor by time they deployed  this will not be case with web components  web components in browser re viewing this on  they aren t going away  may say  react isn t going away  that s reasonable  mean    jquery didn t go anywhere    so why did all move away from for these advanced platforms  s all  just  javascript right  react s destiny pegged to facebook s desire for it; which means wordpress will have to keep pace with where they take that community  don t view this as long term sustainable  will a wordpress site site  without being touched  still function correctly 10 years from now when needing to update gutenblocks as well as surrounding js library ecosystem  hax output no longer requires hax  content pulled into hax just reading dom then processing  disappear tomorrow our elements will still work  since treat dom as an api  will continue to expand at a rate that far outpaces gutenberg  a story our components work anywhere  with or without hax  make a public website (like this one re viewing)  as part of build make a new card element  go from usage on this website to generalized  hax capable element in about 5 minutes  web expands our platform  not wordpress  wordpress (drupal too) will never keep pace with our expansion just given this fact  as build web  build up base of legos for all of  not just specific pockets of  accessibility gutenberg accessibility have had a rocky time out of gate  learning react  just to participate in accessibility testing a non starter  keep our web components compiled not bundled in part for this reason  anyone run an accessibility audit on something make  find element in dom that wraps what failed  make a report  they also see file came from trace back to source; which what they ll find   looks   like   html  this may seem petty s not  re actually at odds with web component community standards (which to roll things like webpack \/ bundlers to reduce assets delivered)  s more important to us that anyone find  diagnose  remix what re doing  traceability by average web professional (not wp pro + react pro) critical to long term sustainability  hax also originates in higher education  where have legal               ethical responsibilities to generate  maintain improve accessibility of what produce  web components represent an immense opportunity for us to generate a more open accessible web as a result of remix  power consolidation please don t confuse charity with corporate interests   oh thank for this editor     which only produced because need to in order to try go after markets like wix squarespace  goal isn t democratizing web anymore  s consolidating power under one banner  non conspiratorially  less people that understand authoring experience of wordpress  more business for wordpress com vendor space  our component library highly readable  has tooling (and soon front end assets) to completely automate writing of wiring for our editor  editor outputs no longer tied to editor; seek a great rebalancing of powers of web  hax has ties into multiple cms ecosystems already easily be ported over to others  yes  re building a  cms  to manage pages because editor eliminates vast majority of needs for database driven anything  yes  ll continue to criticize database backed solutions (while still having to maintain my own slew of them)  however  haxcms will be completely built out of open reusable components that aside from our theme scaffolding will make sense in other solutions (that non hax)  actively tearing down power structures in methodologies by which approaching development  publish all our components to webcomponents org  a public  non cms specific location  ve seen talk of wp having its own blocks catalog  which makes sense    again  why consolidate ux discovery to one ecosystem  why develop for a single ecosystem when improve web holistically  not being a jerk  gutenberg a fantastic idea with a lot of effort resources sleepless nights poured into  will empower people to produce things open source those great things  think threatens long term sustainability  accessibility  development interest  think web components provide a unique opportunity to tear down power silos ve all built over last decade  shouldn t need someone else in order to present yourself online  shouldn t cost anything  should have total ownership control over your information  shouldn t be tied to any platform beyond browser itself  have a unique opportunity to ensure that happens \u00c2\u00a0don t throw your efforts into a single silo that will let

coffers after all)  that whole thing had me thinking about access to information ideas of aaron swartz      ; namely that information seeks to be free  in years since aaron s unfortunate death  ve seen silicon valley accelerate in its quest to put up barriers to free flow of information in name of a new enemy: user experience  facebook:  have best experiences  so should share             all your content here without thinking about twitter:  have fastest experience  so should share             your stream of consciousness here without thinking about medium:  have best writing experience  so should share your ideas here while working them out   these platforms  these digital silos  do empower people to share have a voice  they antithetical to open content open access vision that aaron often credited with  was passed along some links recently related to indieweb       internet of ownership        got me thinking  hax haxcms in this sphere of local control  better control  better tools  more access to those tools  haddn t really thought through additional technical requirements not talked about in that pursuit  namely  that every screen has a right to content  extending vision of information seeks to be free every screen possess has a right to access content  if connected to internet  there should be no barriers between that screen web based html data structures

ideas with one another        platforms require to use them manipulate into using them more  they connect to people at a price; that will always connect through them  one of major methods of dissolving decentralized individual ownership of web was by killing rss  google played a huge role in this through killing s podcasting platform; not that they controlled universe in this regard  forced content producers to think of other ways of doing syndication  namely  through google apple app stores  want to bring old web back here s plan  beyond just hax haxcms  its important to realize philosophical design decisions that have now been baked into haxcms platform which ll list as features in headings below  automatic rss atom feed generation rss atom allow sites to share updates about what s been produced  (an old) format that a pure form of notifying others sites about your latest postings work  haxcms now automatically generates these data feeds then provides buttons for designers that automatically wire them up  this will let more people start publishing in these formats without having to think about or know they exist  automatic sitemap \/ robots generation for search engines to find  need good seo  haxcms outputs with seo best practices automatically baked into platform  again  shouldn t have to think about getting high search rankings in order to do  should just happen  automatic offline \/ lack of internet usage all haxcms sites what known as  progressive web apps  (pwa)  a pwa leverage modern browser techniques to allow users to install your website on their phone (or laptop)  which improves performance makes reading more enjoyable  also  if a user has been to your website (installed or not) loses internet connection  they ll still have access to all of content of your site (minus things like remotely loaded images \/ links to other websites)  this ensures a high quality experience even when internet of low quality (big for rural  low income  mass transit or otherwise lacking in data connection users)  support for all screens this was a tricky one  haxcms now able to deliver to all platforms of web going back to ie6 \/ ff 3 \/ safari 4       possibly even earlier  for reference  ie6 20 years old  \u00c2\u00a0  in order to achieve this  ve implemented a (brilliant) progressive enhancement strategy that works like so: modern \/ evergreen  get highest quality  fastest method of shipping assets to (~85% traffic)      slightly behind \/ off version  get same quality  slightly slower to load (es5 versions  still works great tho  ~8% traffic)   edge \/ semi modern not web components native platforms   get an alternate experience though still web components (~4%)      ie 6   11 \/ anything made in last 20 years  or has javascript disabled (~3% or less)  get an iframe \/ dramatically simplified version of site  web components in content won t work  ll still get all images text of website        \u00c2\u00a0this approach will let us hit effectively 100% of global web traffic with content              without changing workflow of  publisher  own content  own your experience  hax current market that has forced

begun working towards that goal that might better plan for a decentralized future as well  \u00c2\u00a0decentralization be scary  after all  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s everyone for themselves  \u00c2\u00a0the fear was well expressed to me in a phone call recently:  anytime i\u00e2\u0080\u0099m told we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building ourselves feel like must be doing something wrong      yes  historically this accurate  \u00c2\u00a0if went (truly) alone without any underlying structure were \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoing wrong\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00c2\u00a0starting from a single line of code working from there not way to go about tackling our problems  what i\u00e2\u0080\u0099m calling for though isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to start from nothing; far from  \u00c2\u00a0today would like to introduce a phrase heard recently that hit me so hard had to write about  \u00c2\u00a0it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phrase i\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been looking for to describe what i\u00e2\u0080\u0099m building towards what i\u00e2\u0080\u0099m personally calling for in future development strategies: structured anarchy     (sa)  at first glance this phrase may seem set against itself  \u00c2\u00a0how something be structured have order  while at same time lacking order structure entirely  take forest as an example: \u00c2\u00a0while look at forest say that trees have been chaotically dispersed; see trees as individual\u00c2\u00a0components\u00c2\u00a0of that random landscape  \u00c2\u00a0they have defining characteristics all have a similar underlying structure  \u00c2\u00a0some trees different shapes after years of growth  they all generally same (having leaves  branches  roots  etc)  this what hope to build with our future implementations of elms  \u00c2\u00a0a forest  so dense seemingly random in layout that there no organization  \u00c2\u00a0some trees having more branches than others  or different colored leaves; yet  still all sharing same underlying structure coming from same source of seeds  have been implementing our own form of sa in house by slowly moving us further further from centralized systems  \u00c2\u00a0here a chart of our move towards structured anarchy since 2006: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 start out very centralized  only housing our own core content in dreamweaver files  \u00c2\u00a0then see slowly transition from a centralized system  to our own  \u00c2\u00a0the process continues increases in pace as shore up more more of our own information architecture  my plans of structured anarchy  often\u00c2\u00a0referred\u00c2\u00a0to as project ulmus  has helped us put our destiny in our own hands     given us greater control of how want to develop structure course materials going forward  \u00c2\u00a0the idea being that continue to provide better experiences for our students staff through continued refinement of our own infrastructure while centralized authorities must remain relatively static in order to serve general population  part of our success with sa involves organic spread of technology  \u00c2\u00a0we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had many early adopters locally now time has come to attempt to spread reach of elms further  \u00c2\u00a0later this year  a full version of elms core platform will be released with more systems to follow by end of 2011 into 2012  \u00c2\u00a0currently  working on elms core \u00e2\u0080\u0093 alpha 3 planned to be production ready by august 2011 (in house) with public internal releases shortly there after  elms core just first in a series of distributions that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see released in an effort to not only nudge us further away from central systems help increase platform sustainability through adoption  \u00c2\u00a0currently second third distribution releases are:  asset management component to simplify embedding copyright management of media     student collaboration component with a heavy focus on critique community      idea isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to make each of these \u00e2\u0080\u009cproducts\u00e2\u0080\u009d if want to call them that  do everything      \u00c2\u00a0the idea to have each one focused on meeting a certain goal using minor apis authentication to knit all systems together  this has shown to not be an issues for students or faculty (through anecdotal evidence as well as minor surveys) over last five years that have been moving in this direction  so message hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed from last year  \u00c2\u00a0technology has been empowering in past continues to be today  \u00c2\u00a0as such  constantly able to do more with less (elms still a one shop  one person show) look to keep moving in an increasingly independent direction  look forward to coming year where this discussion may take us instructionally as well

me oldest yelling happily while youngest sat passively enjoying  afterwards always make a big deal when do something big so got off picked him up celebrated took a picture to commemorate achievement  later sitting quietly he told me how much fun was  unprovoked  about how s really not as scary as he thought that s  only 1 hill   he couldn t wait to tell his mom  he had won  he grew up  (and he got cotton candy as a reward so  know)  was older ones turn  jokingly pointed to a very high tower (he likes rides sit in they fall slightly in place only ever kiddie one)  x scream tower 120 feet high

would do then said no said maybe kept dancing around so walked back over to told him was up to him  he stared at nervously finally saw some other kids around his age so he got in line  he bounced around nervously  talking to himself quietly then when was his turn got up sat on a side by himself  this alone scary for him  he s extremely sociable w\/ ppl around him on rides think comforts him (i

giving s ok thumbs up  tower reaches top drops immediately he comes down  visibly upset re cheering  happy he made trip back safe wanting to embrace him since he s really visibly upset  he gets off ride  still crying  shaking  runs back off come to front of ride to greet him (the celebration w\/ his bro) tell him s ok now he doesn t have to be upset give him a hug  he pushes away:  m going on again  right now   say huh  shaking  upset   not at anxiety of ride  he s upset with himself that he was scared at all bc he had missed out on fun of  hug him again  tighter until he stops being upset  then he goes back in line (to surprise of young woman operating ride to see him)  he says was awesome he won t be afraid this time  he sits in exact same seat  loves every minute of this time  he gets off says he wants to do again because s awesome  laugh have to move on to other rides (his bro getting annoyed at this point)  he keeps talking about afterwards about how proud he that he did  t

open apereo \u00c2\u00a0i was in your learn web components workshop  have a question that ve been struggling with for last day  figured would probably know answer off top of your head \u00c2\u00a0   m trying to pass an event up from one component to another  let me describe quickly construction of things: have this one chunk of code  a document tree view  that use in 2 3 locations  ve been having to maintain 2 3 code bases by hand  which makes me go  perfect candidate for web component   so turned into  doc tree  things were more or less ok    a couple pieces of weren t hooked up any more figured that was part of re implementation process  inside of tree view have a chunk of code that shows up in a couple of other places as well  a document source selector  so figured was another obvious candidate  so made  doc selector  this where ran into my problem  when doc selector document source changes  doc tree needs to be notified that happened what changed to  then doc tree updates s content to reflect new source  this what m stuck on  how do bubble up that event  hey toben   this one of those expert level achievement unlocked  a web components master  type of problems  there s so many ways to solve (state management of what describe) that be a bit nuts  find best to pick a convention stick to  so best place point to some parts of hax which definitely stretched levels of my comprehension of how to do this  ok  so here s 2 design patterns in hax  pick which works best for  body level attachment: https:\/\/github com\/lrnwebcomponents\/silly hax game\/blob\/master\/silly hax game html#l156   in this methodology  your element listens to events at body of document  yet says  when hear this  bind back to me   this in  this _verifyaction bind(this)  portion of that code  calls an event (and scope) to element defined in  yet s listening on body of document  this easiest way by far of accomplishing this  event \/ property\u00c2\u00a0juggling: https:\/\/github com\/lrnwebcomponents\/hax body\/blob\/master\/hax store html#l1507 l1509  \u00c2\u00a0which gets attached at\u00c2\u00a0https:\/\/github com\/lrnwebcomponents\/hax body\/blob\/master\/hax store html#l503  \u00c2\u00a0which then calls this effectively fires an update against    itself\u00c2\u00a0https:\/\/github com\/lrnwebcomponents\/hax body\/blob\/master\/hax store html#l1016 l1017   so this may seem like an odd paradigm its really useful when don t actually know structure of objects on document (for example  elements in hax registering when document loads as to who actually talk its language) \u00c2\u00a0https:\/\/github com\/lrnwebcomponents\/hax body\/blob\/master\/hax body html#l288   so hax data flow goes like this: there s a variable\u00c2\u00a0 store  \/\u00c2\u00a0state manager (hax store) which all changing of global properties needs to consistently flow through that  write function (which store keeps itself as a global namespace so then all calls to write store from that)  store  effectively writes itself  which then triggers a call to fire a consistent event saying  a property has changed here s its value   then  everyone else that cares (like hax body in this example) has said so listen (at document body level) for any call of a property changing  then subsequently updates itself  this how have elements anywhere in tree yet subscribing to events in a uniform  global way no matter structure  listen at top  telephone back down to element in question to handle processing "},{"id":"item-e165f124-11d5-4b9a-06ed-7b6bf1802ca8","title":"NGDLE is really

out 2008 as a device for streaming netflix by 2010 starts to support other apps like hulu  well   anyone that wanted on  see roku had an open source sdk that effectively said  if implement this notify us  ll show up in our channel listing   this allowed anyone that had media to stream access to peoples  homes that had a roku box connected to a tv  other reasons roku was transformative from a user experience perspective:  single box to attach to tv using existing standards (hdmi or rca)  approachable input device (simple remote) with power button activation via tv  no need to understand urls after initial on screen directions to setup an account  icons \/ images in big bright squares telling what going to access  start watching \/ searching within that universe of media roku has transformed space because took all those urls that were always available for netflix  hulu  youtube  vimeo rest  turned into something that non technical people could hook up in 5 minutes  ease of use approachability of technology allowed to start to decentralize disrupt cable industry (which as of this writing in free fall ) lms cable  so if lms similar in positioning to cable  how achieve our roku moment where people decentralized collapse usage of lms (forcing to transform how behaves)  industry has plenty of  hulu   netflix  counterparts in form of systems that start to behave so much like something different that people adopt them in full they start to look like lmss of their own  start with a video quiz tool  add badging  add certification  add a series of trainings  add quizzing  add rosters    hey  this looks like an lms (see: d\u00e2\u0080\u0099arcy norman effect )  so how do build ngdle solutions in such a way that they don t just become next lms which trying desperately

moment our industry so desperately needs  sources  gizmos (wtf )   sources  a hax source anything that has or be given information  media  content  etc  if supplying that information  would look like an upload field:  upload field in gizmo browser   so would drag drop a file to upload  let s say s a  mp4 file  hax would ask s available sources who handle video  youtube vimeo anything else would raise their hands  d select where want video to go would start uploading to that source   gizmos  gizmos (architecturally webcomponents ) in hax your way of presenting information visually  so either supply media for a source (our  mp4 file) or search select one:  search sources of information for content   source says  hey  ve got something that looks like a video  any gizmos handle video   our gizmos raise their hand as to who display video  user selects gizmo for job: gizmo browser to select right display for job   then they presented a form for filling in additional details: form fields for configuring how to embed this   after filling out form  ll get placed into content go about doing what do best  teach  video placed in page    desktop app  now imagine if hax were a desktop app   built using same methodology as roku where there distributed apps that all pulled together  because of webcomponents an awesome desktop builder called electron  pursue both at same time  ll be able to improve distributed building capabilities in elms:ln while also putting these capabilities in a desktop publishing app  app will then be able to write html which work anywhere  with or without elms:ln \/ other sources  then also have ability to deploy to elms:ln s course delivery capabilities  or a static location  or a git repo  or any lms  by building lms system agnostic  deploy anywhere  in

years)  some will argue market caught up with them (amazon specifically) what really happened  amazon embraced a decentralized access methodology  aka internet centric access development method  by increasing pressure in server supply chain automation space they were able to collapse theocratic toy purchase market  forces to support which will decentralize theocratic knowledge production market support these efforts  collectively disrupt theocratic knowledge production market  paul hibbits course hub gravcms project   reclaim hosting   domain of one s own   tsugi    stand up for voices that

(roku does 1x two factor authorizations binding app to user); what would look like  how would function  what would transform in our process development as institutions  our sharing  our ability to discover produce oer  imagine having an app for your institution that stitched together all of services available to user in order for them to leverage institution to s fullest  instead of training every faculty on what s possible  where things in organization  then constantly blasting emails to update hope people realize system jus paid $200 000 for actually known about to be used  what if they had an app that gave them a small notice that now they had access to this item in their ecosystem  imagine if anyone could use an interface on their local machine of choice to author highly accessible  interactive  engaging oer tagged material without need for any technical knowledge  just pick up app  start clicking authoring engaging educational experiences  what if that material was then in a format that could be imported anywhere  what if saved to box other solutions already have leveraged development technologies in order to keep that information discoverable sharable  what if instead of having to go out look for oer other media to remix into teaching learning  that material came to us on our app could easily ingest  so yes  s not conjecture  that s what re building this open source  s also being engineered in such a way that has no requirement of using elms:ln s already usable enough to illustrate concept across multiple platforms locally as well as on web in cmss  this talk will

blog post recently on not just being a critic instead being a person of action  well  here s why was critical  believe that my mission to be here  in this place  in this time  to try strive towards zero cost education  tools of production should be free accessible to anyone everyone  content media materials produced should be fluid  working anywhere in any combination  being easy to find  easy to remix  easy to learn from anywhere   how then do people make money     zero cost  mean really   yeah    probably; very difficult to legitimately hit zero on anything  people don t pay for text editors anymore    do they (unless your a developer call an ide even those usually free)  someone makes right  comes from somewhere  well  person or organization that says  hey  t do our job without a new way to edit text  one ultimately paying for  if what they re selling isn t text editors s code  then they give away their editor without losing out on money  unique network effect of this that don t see a lot of a market for text editors ;)  if people going to up give away something amazing for free (because s what provides them that generates revenue not thing itself) then they afford to do so  also depresses potential for a market to exist  if people clean parks out of their own free will then no one make money providing services to clean parks  whatever your example  there s plenty of examples of markets not being able to exist because  there s no money there   yeah    why  what conditions force a market to not be able to exist  this what m after  have been for some time  how cause network effects to eliminate established markets  how accelerate decline collapse of corrupt markets  could call that for proits  could call that greedy edtech  or bloated public institutions; whatever call corrupt  how actively work to fix that  release of all of materials of production in establishment of educational experiences my way of fixing that  if content free  if learning objects free  if material remixable  adaptable  easy to understand translate  if process of production documented tools released  if everything in creation production  knowledge  all of  released     people will still want to get credentialed  validated certified by institutions gatekeepers of knowledge outcomes  students aren t paying to produce a video about how to effectively treat minor wounds  they paying for certification verification that they know how to treat minor wounds as a result of entire training  putting that video on youtube them saying  hey watched that  isn t going to hold same weight (ever) as an institution saying  yes  verify that ______  knows how to treat minor wounds  among other things      story a child in poverty has access to a 3g based cellphone  they don t have access to quality medical advise (outside of that device)  they don t have much in way of clothing  shelter from elements  a friend of theirs gets hurt; perhaps only method of them knowing what to do to best help them via that cell phone  they search for resources on how to treat a wound come up with how to do so on limited supplies  a how to  produced as part of basic medical training which was sponsored by a university for training grad students traveling to remote parts of africa  demonstrates how to properly treat a wound when having access to limited resources  child treats wound  friend healed wound doesn t get infected  child  inspired by devices ability to provide life altering advise  starts reading through other materials provided  maybe this inspires child to be a lifelong

sounds of use to your institution  good  let s work together on     problem faculty staff have no idea what they use at our institution  no matter how many registries of information or solutions provide  people will need to practically be marketted to just to know they exist in sea of information about what makes university work  beyond this  there no way to provide continuous innovation to those not at high touch units which work hand in hand with faculty to produce highly experimental course spaces approaches  even if could find things need  very few of them talk to each other  their user experiences all over map  most aren t very good for creating materials without needing to understand technical topics (like html)  this isn t a psu specific problem  duke has an illustration that highlights 93+ solutions available to faculty  many of which don t talk even if they knew them all  how to solve problem of finding once getting there creating engaging experiences     leading questions  what if faculty staff involved in producing instructional experiences had an app that told them what services existed made instantly possible to use   what would look like institutionally what would use experience look like   what needs would have technically in order to support this       vision this vision of hax  a distributed instructional creation tool  hax be viewed as a public demo here   important thing to keep in mind with this that desktop publishing of applications be done using html  making them far easier to build when just make work on web  imagine if users could log into app on their laptop or phone just create  creating a new course  start one on your local machine with press of a button publish to canvas  drupal  elms:ln  gravcms or a static website  want to see what colleagues have shared from their courses  fork their materials by searching an institution protected repository right from app or connect to global shared object repositories  instead of trying to market to faculty staff what services available  have people utilize a unified app which connects to registry of everything available to them for teaching learning  want to stream video  upload to app ll publish to youtube or video provider university supports  want to create h5p don t understand hosting  build in app ll save to correct  ferpa valid location  want to create a slideshow  drag drop a series of images which automatically get uploaded to amazon s3 then click a ui to  build  your slideshow  worry about accessibility  hax will take care of for automatically without ability to make in accessible content  content in hax accessible by default due to game changing technology called webcomponents   let s get faculty staff out of business of understanding html

making possible for individual developers to leverage open source automation to do awesome things  today write to talk about next thing want to bring back to our island which think  technology to bring about an open ecosystem for next generation digital learning environment (ngdle)     webcomponents explained that technology  webcomponents  webcomponents  which find out more about on webcomponents org  a four part browser standard that fundamentally changes what s possible in web based application development  important thing to know that webcomponents allows developers to define custom html elements expresses how browser handles them   so  bringing this back to education: use this technology standard in order to build pedagogically focused  valid  html tags       quick note this a standard that all major browser vendors have committed to adopting largely have  though polyfills required to get full browser support  also leaving ie6\/7\/8\/9\/10 world behind (the good news  so has microsoft )     ngdle backstory for four years  ve been building elms: learning network ; trying to build a platform that produce sustain innovation in educational technology  for about that long  educause has talked about concept of ngdle; what might look like  what might do  how to do  because s a big concept to unpack  s taken a few years to get people all on board with idea to agree that s not an lms (much like webcomponents was proposed in 2011 yet didn t become a real thing implemented until 2016)  because of patterns of behaviors methodology of elms:ln currently consider only public ngdle  for that reason  re misunderstood if ngdle lego ing \/ app ifying lms; elms:ln wants to be grid plate  fundamental base plate to be plugged into  a routing system to stitch all together satisfy need that no vendor will ever provide: a middleware to pull our ecosystems together     so how do all lego ok  so back to webcomponents  if have a gridplate (you could provide your own  m not suggesting elms:ln be only one) then need lego bricks to plug into board  what fits that paradigm  webcomponents allow to take simple forms of html build up into increasingly complex elements  let s look at a simple concept of a custom tag how would start to get towards pedagogically centric html  just like html  custom tags go into other custom tags  also use retain semantic meaning just like html markup  so let s imagine that had a semantic  custom element that provides same thing as above  now have a tag called paper button  every time want to do above  put that tag  ok  now let s say want a comment card  a comment card might be: which then use in something bigger now have a tag called comment list  or discussion board   a discussion board could be made out of any number of other smaller lego brick tags  now wire up to a backend to save data ve got a fully functional html element that be shared remixed anywhere so long as someone provides a backend to store  s going to work     critical concepts that webcomponents provide to ngdle if do this right  visual consistency   right now when using multiple systems everyone decrys cognitive load on students  webcomponents provide a common visual design language templated approach to help alleviate this  everything will feel like s same (even if s not)  accessibility   because most accessibility mistakes happen when html created  this allows us to make elements with high accessibility baked in  eliminating ability for end users to make that design element inaccessible   maintainability   if were to produce a tag such as lrn assignment  that expressed an assignment s properties visually  now swap out guts of that tag so long as properties going into same don t need to update any existing content produced   interoperability   by design  anything that imports custom element (which jsut an html file supplying definition of what to do with that tag) will work  these will work in any system because s user s browser that s unpacking what specification itself gives element definition encapsulation   standards based approach   by using a common methodology for front end creation  standardize ux interaction patterns of our users allow developers to all work together utilize each other s lego bricks   schema without schema   start to wire up our custom elements to be schematized for indexing by search engines or our own advanced crawlers  ensuring there additional semantic meaning to our content no matter where lives  this has huge implications for oer  for example   common authoring   because just made this  works anywhere       anywhere  yeah  anywhere  hax another step towards my vision of ngdle solutions craft when work in this approach  an authoring experience that pull data from anywhere assemble in a standards based format (html) which be deployed anywhere  imagine having identical authoring instructional capabilities regardless of where an instructor assembling a course  open system  do in open  closed to institution  do in lms  training exercise or learning module on a random blog  yeah  with an ngdle based authoring approach  everything be a mini lms everything feed other things to make new learning experiences  in coming months through demonstration  documentation seemingly impossible levels of progress (webcomponents + elmsln make application development trivial) ll begin to show path towards anyone building an ngdle  what provides users  how sharing things across institutions systems  how start to dissolve all learning systems into ngdle based worldview to

them have made things so easy  so wyziwig ed  so fast that s not interesting to them  \u00c2\u00a0this will lead to less ideas  less choice  only a few technical authorities who effectively kick door shut on all those who come after them  \u00c2\u00a0a truly  apple (and a few others) world of elite companies as well as a few elite open source advocates along for ride  connect dots  speak out for more choice  question why someone giving something for free ;) "},{"id":"item-c6866e7a-1981-8c76-293a-0b96181e4945","title":"Sustainable Systems Development: A moral issue","location":"sustainable-systems-development-a-moral-issue","text":"sustainability has been a  hot  topic for last five plus years now  often talked about in context of environmentalist movement or farming  allow me to give concept a bit of a technical moral spin  sustainability all about planning for future of humanity  what our children world s children will experience as a result of our actions today  do think your house will be standing 100 years from now  how about 1000s  like pantheon  no  me neither  this issue ve come to with systems design  came into a world where people did things with a lack of planning for future directions would take us  didn t create issues  all of our responsibility to fix  how many systems have used that needed to be explained to far beyond 5 minutes  how many wasteful positions do see that maintain a single  custom system  how many\u00c2\u00a0additional\u00c2\u00a0positions do see as a result of poor  bloated work flows  how many people know how to do your job  this all brings me to issue of morality in systems design \/ implementation  systems should be designed in such a way that they not only easy to use easy to maintain sustain for decades  not months years \u00c2\u00a0 breaking down walls between those creating system those in need of a system isn t just a best practice  s a moral prerogative  technical elites (haves) have a moral obligation to design develop systems in such a way that everyone (even have nots) use them \u00c2\u00a0experience design (ux) not just a  nice to have  requirement  a moral issue    \u00c2\u00a0it immoral to design something that allows system to be dependent upon your knowledge (or any small group of people) to continue running  yeah  believe me  s very tempting to hand a system off to a client who has no clue what they re doing intentionally design so ll always have to be involved  big money big money no wammies   \u00c2\u00a0stop  s also far more difficult to design in such a way that don t have to be involved (even as much) in future \u00c2\u00a0 let s face  that s less money for probably more work to get a product out to client  there has been a bit of a code of ethics push in drupal community which has had me thinking about all this so d like to make one of my own \u00c2\u00a0 these some of principles that strive towards in everything write in every interaction with those in community: immoral to design something that only understand how works    systems must be designed with user groups in mind (ux)    every line of code\u00c2\u00a0should seek to empower people to never have to know exists          solutions must be simple  elegant understandable by those tasked with managing system after deployed     talk early  talk often  more transparent in your design  development  delivery processes easier would be for someone else to pick up your work run with    be passionate in code write; if re not into  move on       write code to do lots of good bad things; don t take a job where don t agree with result    feedback  positive or negative feedback should be responded to in same way    leverage developed code as much as so that glue \/ custom modules as small as possible    realize that your never done (and be satisfied with it)  re simply advancing ball a little further down field every day  month  year  generation"}]
