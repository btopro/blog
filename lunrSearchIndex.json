I was there to talk web components, block editors, and of course #HAXTheWeb\n\n\n\n\n.\n\nThe conversation steered into the advantages of web components over past technology solutions and libraries and is a really good consolidation of a lot of my thoughts about web components and their importance in building a more sustainable, open web. Half way through we turn to HAX and I'm left open to rant... (so I do)\nI'd like to unpack a statement because I realize that while I did an ok job of explaining it, I'd like to have it written down if it end sup coming up. I said something intentionally controversial because if we don't challenge those with power, regardless of their intention, then we are left accepting powerlessness as a feature instead of the bug that it is.\nThe quote\nThe takes place at 44:41 remaining in the show. Please subscribe to, rate and review their podcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n but I wanted to link to the audio here in context in case you wanted to listen to it while reading why I feel this way.\n\n  I see Gutenberg as a\ndirect existential threat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n to the open web [and OER].\nSo this critique is not of the people who work on Gutenberg. It is a deeper philosophical question of trust and control in open source and the open web. When I say do you trust Matt. I don't mean as a person, I mean do you trust one person with control of your entire UX, forever.\nIt's a fair comparison to say the same could be lodged at me in designing HAX; and yes I am aware other people have worked on Gutenberg (and HAX has more then just me on it...). My primary criticisms grouped:\nSustainability\nReact is the flavor of this five year segment of time and we're coming up on its end. Being from Drupal I saw core developers jump on javascript trains that had already fallen out of favor by the time they deployed. This will not be the case with web components. Web components are in the browser you're viewing this on. They aren't going away.\nYou may say \"But React isn't going away\" and that's reasonable. But I mean... jQuery didn't go anywhere... so why did we all move away from it for these advanced platforms? It's all \"just\" javascript right?\nReact's destiny is pegged to Facebook's desire for it; which means WordPress will have to keep pace with where they take that community. I don't view this as long term sustainable. Will a WordPress site site, without being touched, and still function correctly 10 years from now when needing to update the Gutenblocks as well as surrounding JS library ecosystem?\nHAX output no longer requires HAX. Content pulled into HAX is just reading DOM and then processing it. We can disappear tomorrow and our elements will still work. Since we treat the DOM as an API, we will continue to expand it at a rate that far outpaces Gutenberg.\nA story\nOur components work anywhere, with or without HAX. We make a public website (like this one you're viewing). As part of the build we make a new card element. It can go from usage on this website to generalized, HAX capable element in about 5 minutes. The web expands our platform, not WordPress. WordPress (Drupal too) will never keep pace with our expansion just given this fact.\nAs we build the web, we build up the base of legos for all of it. Not just specific pockets of it.\nAccessibility\nGutenberg and accessibility have had a rocky time out of the gate. Learning React, just to participate in accessibility testing is a non-starter. We keep our web components compiled but not bundled in part for this reason. Anyone can run an accessibility audit on something we make, find the element in the DOM that wraps what failed, and make a report. They can also see the file it came from and trace it back to the source; which what they'll find...looks...like...html.\nThis may seem petty but it's not. We're actually at odds with the web component community standards (which is to roll things like Webpack \/ bundlers to reduce assets delivered). It's more important to us that anyone can find, diagnose, and remix what we're doing, and the traceability by the average web professional (not WP pro + React pro) is critical to long term sustainability.\nHAX also originates in higher education, where we have legal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n and ethical responsibilities to generate, maintain and improve the accessibility of what we produce. Web components represent an immense opportunity for us to generate a more open and accessible web as a result of remix.\nPower consolidation\nPlease don't confuse charity with corporate interests. \"OH THANK YOU FOR THIS EDITOR\"... which you only produced because you need to in order to try and go after markets like Wix and Squarespace. The goal isn't democratizing the web anymore, it's consolidating power under one banner. Non-conspiratorially, the less people that understand the authoring experience of WordPress, the more business for WordPress.com and vendor space.\nOur component library is highly readable, has tooling (and soon front end assets) to completely automate the writing of the wiring for our editor. Editor outputs are no longer tied to the editor; we seek a great rebalancing of the powers of the web. HAX has ties into multiple CMS ecosystems already and can easily be ported over to others.\nYes, we're building a \"CMS\" to manage pages because the editor eliminates the vast majority of needs for database driven anything. Yes, I'll continue to criticize database backed solutions (while still having to maintain my own slew of them). However, HAXcms will be completely built out of open and reusable components that aside from our theme scaffolding will make sense in other solutions (that are non-HAX). We are actively tearing down power structures in the methodologies by which we are approaching development.\nWe publish all our components to webcomponents.org, a public, non-CMS specific location. I've seen talk of WP having its own Blocks catalog, which makes sense... but again, why consolidate UX discovery to one ecosystem. Why develop for a single ecosystem when you can improve the web holistically?\nNot being a jerk.\nGutenberg is a fantastic idea with a lot of effort and resources and sleepless nights poured into it. It will empower people to produce things and is open source and those are great things. I think it threatens long term sustainability, accessibility, and development interest. I think web components provide a unique opportunity to tear down the power silos we've all built over the last decade.\nYou shouldn't need someone else in order to present yourself online. It shouldn't cost you anything. You should have total ownership and control over your information. It shouldn't be tied to any platform beyond the browser itself.\nWe have a unique opportunity to ensure that happens.\u00c2\u00a0Don't throw your efforts into a single silo that will let you down.\n"},{"id":"item-cd716dd0-59b0-a24d-1ddb-2779369c52b2","title":"2018 Innovation Submission","location":"2018-innovation-submission","text":"\nThis is my submission to the TLT 2018 Open Innovation Challenge. \n\n\nWe have amazing capabilities and solutions available to us as an R1 research institution. But like many of fellow institutions, we suffer from the scale of our own success. The recent IT Transformation audit highlighted a duplication of efforts and lack of cohesive user experience that arises from us have many systems bought and built for serving faculty and student needs.\n\n\nThat is why I am proposing we develop a desktop app version of a technology we call HAX.\n\n\nHAX, short for Headless Authoring Experience, is an authoring solution that can bridges platforms in order create a pathway toward a more sustainable, cohesive user experience in a platform agnostic manner. Imagine the best features of Canvas, Drupal, ELMS, Plone, Pressbooks, Evolution and more but available to anyone to use regardless of access to those platforms. It may sound pie in the sky, but HAX is illustrating this possibility already in College of Arts and Architecture and Eberly College of Science.\n\n\nHAX also creates a unified way to find, create, remix and distribute content. It is currently implemented into 7 different platforms and can do in-place searching of YouTube, NASA Images, Wikipedia, Google Poly and more. HAX's ability to integrate remote content sources inline could allow faculty to search Kaltura, Office 365 and anything else through one consistent interface.\n\n\nBy creating an authoring solution that works anywhere, via the new mobile \/ desktop app, we could democratize the production of OER and closed course content while radically improving quality and experience.\n"},{"id":"item-15cbf071-ff46-4ec6-90dd-35c57537af97","title":"Fortify","location":"fortify","text":"\n\"FORT. NIGHT.\"\nThey yell. Not in the way that teenagers rushing home from school to dominate their friends yell but in the way of innocence. The yell of the joy of dad suggesting that we build a fort together.\nTo build.\nI love building things with my kids. Whether it's a pinewood derby car (where the adults do most of the work cause... saws) or lego sets or snowmen or pillow and blanket forts in the basement, it's all... everything I've ever wanted.\nI love building with my kids. Watching them get overjoyed at the simple and peculiar things. Like taking all their blankets out of the closet, ripping the couch cushions off to stack them juuuuuust right.\nWe also enjoy playing zombie \/ monster attack in the basement. The lights go off and the flash lights come out, trying to find the zombie \/ monster that's roaming the basement, scratching the walls.\nYouTube entered into the equasion this evening\n\nYoutube helped expand the sense of adventure. I threw on some monster sound effects (suuppper creepy) and then set the phone at one end of the room.\n\nSlowly... creeping to the other side while they were confused (in the dark w\/ flash lights) about all the noises and wondering how I was making creepy sounds like that... I snuck slowly over to the other side of the fort.\n\nJust as a flash light revealed my true, dad form, I lunged at the fort, chasing the children back inside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I really live for\nIt's not all the code. It's not what powers this website even though I may talk about it a lot. It's those two crazies. \"Our crazies\" as my wife and I often say it. They keep us young, fun, silly, and smiling all the time.\nIf I do have any selfish motivation for making this technology it's this -- I want my boys to not only know how much their dad loves them today, but in the future when they come across all the things I've written about them. About our time together. About how they've made me a better person.\nI've tried four times to accomplish that now. Four, different, blogs, all just trying to catalog my journeys through life, sometimes to stop and have an outlet when I'm in the middle of an emotional break (see, Dood\n\n). It took me several hours over multiple days just copying, pasting, reformatting, and correcting those blog posts. My own work. In systems I understood.\nNot again.\nThis is the last migration. To a format that's pure and simple HTML, with web components to orchestrate it all. It's not some cheesy transition from talking about my kids into talking about our tech. It's reality.\nWhen we build tools that make our lives easier, more able to share and express what we experience, others can join a conversation previously not possible. Living through many systems now I can tell you that permanence needs to be just as at the front of your mind as ease of use. Will this last. Will it stand the test of technologies.\nI can finally say that I've landed some place that I can write all about my boys and our adventures without worrying it'll go away. I'll still keep everything pretty vague (I value their anonymity so that they one day may do the same) but I want you to know, they are my world, and they make me the insane, caffeinated person you see at events.\nThey motivate me every day by wanting to build something together.\n"},{"id":"item-8f85b86c-0619-4fb5-8c19-39b49c11e96b","title":"All screens have rights","location":"all-screen-rights","text":"The EU recently passed Article 13\n\n\n\n\n\n, which it's still too early to tell the implications of but it's troubling to say the least. Any time people start trying to legislate 1s and 0s I get concerned; namely, because their interests are in direct competition with those of their citizens (governments enjoy having major international enterprises they can sue to fill their coffers after all).\nThat whole thing had me thinking about access to information and the ideas of Aaron Swartz\n\n\n\n\n\n; namely that information seeks to be free. In the years since Aaron's unfortunate death, we've seen silicon valley accelerate in its quest to put up barriers to the free flow of information in the name of a new enemy: User Experience.\nFacebook: \"We have the best experiences, and so you should share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n all your content here without thinking about it\"Twitter: \"We have the fastest experience, so you should share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n your stream of consciousness here without thinking about it\"Medium: \"We have the best writing experience, so you should share your ideas here while working them out.\"\nThese platforms. These digital silos, do empower people to share and have a voice. But they are antithetical to the open content and open access vision that Aaron is often credited with.\nI was passed along some links recently related to Indieweb\n\n\n\n\n\n and The Internet of Ownership\n\n\n\n\n\n, and it got me thinking. HAX and HAXcms are in this sphere of local control, better control, better tools, more access to those tools, but I haddn't really thought through the additional technical requirements not talked about in that pursuit. Namely, that every screen has a right to content.\nExtending the vision of Information seeks to be Free\nEvery screen you possess has a right to access content. If you are connected to the internet, there should be no barriers between that screen and web based HTML data structures... otherwise known as all information that exists on the internet.\nEvery site you access adopts the web platform standards.. with a catch.\nClick here to upgrade your app?\nNot using Chrome? Click here to switch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou appear to be using an outdated browser, please upgrade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow look, upgrading, and modernizing with the web are nice. Helpful especially to the developer. But if we as developers\nEvery screens have a right to content. The internet has given birth to incredible communications possibilities (duh). But in that rise, we've seen an ebb and flow as far as access to content, ideas and media. Facebook, twitter and others require you to use updated devices and software in order to access their platform.\nI'm sorry let's reframe that\nFacebook, twitter and others require you to upgrade and pay additional monies for modern, fancy devices, in order to read and express ideas with one another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe platforms require you to use them and manipulate you into using them more. They connect you to people but at a price; that you will always connect through them. One of the major methods of dissolving decentralized individual ownership of the web was by killing RSS.\nGoogle played a huge role in this through killing it's podcasting platform; and not that they controlled the universe in this regard, but it forced content producers to think of other ways of doing syndication. Namely, through Google and Apple app stores.\nWe want to bring the old web back\nAnd here's the plan. Beyond just HAX and HAXcms, its important to realize the philosophical design decisions that have now been baked into the HAXcms platform which I'll list as features in headings below.\nAutomatic RSS and Atom feed generation\nRSS and Atom allow sites to share updates about what's been produced. It is (an old) format that is a pure form of notifying others sites about your latest postings and work. HAXcms now automatically generates these data feeds and then provides buttons for designers that automatically wire them up. This will let more people start publishing in these formats without having to think about it or know they exist.\nAutomatic sitemap \/ robots generation\nFor search engines to find you, you need good SEO. HAXcms outputs with SEO best practices automatically baked into the platform. Again, you shouldn't have to think about getting high search rankings in order to do it. It should just happen.\nAutomatic Offline \/ lack of internet usage\nAll HAXcms sites are what is known as \"Progressive Web Apps\" (PWA). A PWA can leverage modern browser techniques to allow users to install your website on their phone (or laptop), which improves performance and makes reading more enjoyable. Also, if a user has been to your website (installed or not) and loses internet connection, they'll still have access to all of the content of your site (minus things like remotely loaded images \/ links to other websites). This ensures a high quality experience even when internet is of low quality (big for rural, low income, mass transit or otherwise lacking in data connection users).\nSupport for all screens\nThis was a tricky one. HAXcms is now able to deliver to all platforms of the web going back to IE6 \/ FF 3 \/ Safari 4\n\n\n\n\n, possibly even earlier. For reference, IE6 is 20 years old\n\n\u00c2\u00a0. In order to achieve this, we've implemented a (brilliant) progressive enhancement strategy that works like so:\nModern \/ evergreen? You get the highest quality, fastest method of shipping assets to you (~85% traffic)\n\n\n\n\n\nSlightly behind \/ off version? You get the same quality, slightly slower to load (ES5 versions, still works great tho. ~8% traffic)\n\n\nEdge \/ semi-modern but not web components native platforms - You get an alternate experience though still web components (~4%)\n\n\n\n\n\nIE 6 - 11 \/ Anything made in the last 20 years, or has javascript disabled (~3% or less). You get an iframe \/ dramatically simplified version of the site. Web components in content won't work, but you'll still get all the images and text of the website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a0This approach will let us hit effectively 100% of global web traffic with content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, without changing the workflow of you, the publisher. Own you content. Own your experience. HAX the current market that has forced us all to require they exist in order to have a voice.

This has shown to not be an issues for students or faculty (through anecdotal evidence as well as minor surveys) over the last five years that we have been moving in this direction.\nSo the message hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed from last year. \u00c2\u00a0Technology has been empowering in the past and it continues to be today. \u00c2\u00a0As such, we are constantly able to do more with less (ELMS is still a one-shop, one-person show) and look to keep moving in an increasingly independent direction.\nI look forward to the coming year and where this discussion may take us instructionally as well as technologically. \u00c2\u00a0Please feel free to offer your two-cents on the concept of Structured Anarchy or our direction in general.\n\n\n\n\n"},{"id":"item-c97a8e67-971e-4e92-8b38-e348c780d072","title":"Golden, shimmering, joy","location":"item-c97a8e67-971e-4e92-8b38-e348c780d072","text":"I had one of the best days of my life. when they happen, you have to write them down.

Where I fall down isn't into the patterns of perfection, it's knowing how much time I spent\nI can code for months and have it judged in a 5 seconds; I need to convey the message to others effectively. Any misstep is the loss of someone to potentially help build that future. It's also a loss of my belief that that time was spent well when it could have been with the boys\nthat coupled w\/ a DM from a friend: \"in building a future for your sons, you should also build it such that you are in that future.\". I took that to heart and applied it today. I slept, took personal time, and took my boys to a nearby vintage amusement park as we have for years\nwe had a great time riding waterslides and to them I'm sure it'll be just another trip we went on. To me, well, I don't write these things down for others, I write them to force myself to replay it in my mind so I can feel that emotion all over again. The rush of freedom.\nNo longer are the days where we go and daddy carries the youngest, he wants to run off and explore on his own. Tackling things that should be far too scary for most 5 year olds with only moderate hesitation. The 7yo doing much the same but w. no fear.\nthey want to explore, play, & meet new friends as they go. We play for awhile, eat, nothing overly different from all the other happy memories we've formed there in the past. Both of them though tried new things, things they were afraid to do without reassurance. I saw them grow\nIt's an amazing, magical thing. These golden memories forming in front of you, dancing in the water, running as fast as they can to ride a short ride they've loved the last several times. I have trouble seeing through the happy tears at the thought of the years we've done this\nI believe firmly in conquering new rides at a young age. The pattern of accomplishment of defeating your fear and reservation is really important to me and I make my kids go on rides with me as soon as they are of height \/ age. Today the youngest road a new roller coaster\nHe was a wreck in line. Watching it, anxiously, as we got closer to the ride entrance he started panicking, his older brother assuring him that it would all be fine and we'd hold his hand wasn't working this time. We got to the ride, sat, and as it started he calmed immediately\nwe road, me and the oldest yelling happily while the youngest sat passively enjoying. Afterwards we always make a big deal when we do something big so we got off we picked him up and celebrated we took a picture to commemorate the achievement.\nLater sitting quietly he told me how much fun it was, unprovoked. About how it's really not as scary as he thought and that it's \"only 1 hill\". He couldn't wait to tell his mom, he had won. He grew up. (and he got cotton candy as a reward so, you know).\nIt was the older ones turn, jokingly I pointed to a very high tower (he likes rides you sit in and they fall slightly in place but only ever kiddie one). The X Scream tower is 120 feet high https:\/\/www.mydelgrossopark.com\/attractions\/rides\/thrill-rides\/xscream-tower\/ \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I said he should ride it. we kept passing it, he wasn't sure\nlater, we walked back towards it, he had said he would do it and then said no and said maybe and kept dancing around it so we walked back over to it and I told him it was up to him. He stared at it nervously and finally saw some other kids around his age so he got in line.\nhe bounced around nervously, talking to himself quietly and then when it was his turn got up and sat on a side by himself. This alone is scary for him, he's extremely sociable w\/ the ppl around him on rides and I think it comforts him (I had to watch the little guy so solo ride)\nlocked in, tower starts moving up, he freaks, I can tell he's really not enjoying it. Very upset, he's working hard not to cry but it's not working. Me and the youngest are on the ground waving and giving the it's ok thumbs up. The tower reaches the top and drops immediately\nhe comes down, visibly upset and we're cheering, happy he made the trip back safe and wanting to embrace him since he's really visibly upset. He gets off the ride, still crying, shaking, runs back off and I come to the front of the ride to greet him (the celebration w\/ his bro)\nI tell him it's ok now and he doesn't have to be upset and give him a hug. He pushes away: \"I'm going on it again, right now.\" I say huh? Shaking, upset.. not at the anxiety of the ride, he's upset with himself that he was scared at all bc he had missed out on the fun of it.\nI hug him again, tighter until he stops being upset, and then he goes back in line (to the surprise of the young woman operating the ride to see him). He says it was awesome and he won't be afraid this time. He sits in the exact same seat, and loves every minute of it this time.\nhe gets off and says he wants to do it again because it's awesome, we laugh and have to move on to other rides (his bro is getting annoyed at this point). He keeps talking about it afterwards about how proud he is that he did it. I can't stop smiling that he did it for him.\nI keep playing the day in my head over & over, it seems like it went so fast. We were there for hours but it felt like only a snapshot in time. And it's those snapshots that I've collected over the years of this project. It's those snapshots that bring me great joy and wreck me.\nI disrupted my day for this. It was amazing. How many times the past 7 years have I missed amazing days because of routine. How much joy have I missed because of the golden handcuffs I left weigh me down from these golden memories. These snapshots of joy developed so quickly\nhe's so big, so wonderful as he looks to tackle the world more & more of his own desire. We're pushing him towards being someone he is proud of, and that's an awesome proud poppa type of feeling, but the little things crush me still for sure. He's too big for certain rides now\nhe watched on the sideline his brother experiencing simple joys that he now can only replay in his mind. He was disappointed about this as you could see the one last time he wanted to ride certain things before growing too big. We road the train to end the day, as we always do\nholding the two of them, they can't possibly understand how happy I am to get to know them. How hard I work bc of how much I love them. It is only in these moments that I hope they see that, as we sit quietly and stare at the tracks on the road ahead, knowing where they take us\nall the way around, for a short glimpse of a time when we could just sit and enjoy each other's smiles while watching the woods roll by. I'm not sure if my known future conditions amplify my emotion at these events or not.\nBefore we left I saw a video that shook me; it was an elderly man getting treatment for Parkinsons that reversed his tremors (like a pace maker but to control the input from your brain). I have a tremor (always have) and my grandfather had Parkinsons, these facts always weigh\nThe worry of forgetting, it is one of the most weighing things as I witness golden memories. It is why I try to write every time I witness one, even if I usually can't see the screen through the pure joy at knowing how happy and how blessed I truly am.\nIf you see me talk or watch one of my videos, know that why coffee helps me wake up in the morning, those two little guys and my wonderful wife keep me energized to put in that 110% every time. They are my world and I wouldn't be me without them.\n"},{"id":"item-5e860e67-2444-0304-6180-9cb7dee92321","title":"Common web component state question","location":"common-web-component-state-question","text":"I wanted to post an answer I gave recently to a web component question post training that we gave at Open Apereo. I asked Toben and he said it was ok if I posted the question \/ answer here because it's a common one. The issue related to state management methodologies when using primitive parts of \"the platform\". You could just use Redux, something my colleague Michael Potter recommends, but I'm more one for smaller methods (and 1 less dependency).\nHey Bryan, this is Toben, we met at Open Apereo.\u00c2\u00a0I was in your learn web components workshop. I have a question that I've been struggling with for the last day, and I figured you would probably know the answer off the top of your head.\u00c2\u00a0\n\n\nI'm trying to pass an event up from one component to another. Let me describe quickly the construction of things:\nI have this one chunk of code, a document tree view, that I use in 2-3 locations. I've been having to maintain the 2-3 code bases by hand, which makes me go \"Perfect candidate for web component!\" So I turned it into \"doc-tree\" and things were more or less ok.\n\n\nA couple pieces of it weren't hooked up any more but I figured that was part of the re-implementation process. Inside of tree view I have a chunk of code that shows up in a couple of other places as well, a document source selector. So I figured it was another obvious candidate. So I made \"doc-selector\" and this is where I ran into my problem. When doc-selector document source changes, doc-tree needs to be notified that it happened and what it changed to, then doc-tree updates it's content to reflect the new source. And this is what I'm stuck on. How do I bubble up that event\n\nHey Toben -\nThis is one of those expert level achievement unlocked, you are a web components master, type of problems. There's so many ways to solve it (state management of what you describe) that it can be a bit nuts. I find it best to pick a convention and stick to it, so the best place I can point you is to some parts of HAX which definitely stretched the levels of my comprehension of how to do this. Ok. so here's 2 design patterns in HAX, you pick which works best for you.\nBody level attachment:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/LRNWebComponents\/silly-hax-game\/blob\/master\/silly-hax-game.html#L156\n\n\nIn this methodology, your element listens to events at the body of the document, yet says \"when you hear this, bind it back to me\". This is in the \"this._verifyAction.bind(this)\" portion of that code. It calls an event (and scope) to the element defined in, but yet it's listening on the body of the document. This is the easiest way by far of accomplishing this.\nEvent \/ Property\u00c2\u00a0Juggling:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/LRNWebComponents\/hax-body\/blob\/master\/hax-store.html#L1507-L1509\n\n\u00c2\u00a0which gets attached at\u00c2\u00a0https:\/\/github.com\/LRNWebComponents\/hax-body\/blob\/master\/hax-store.html#L503\n\n\u00c2\u00a0which then calls this and effectively fires an update against... itself\u00c2\u00a0https:\/\/github.com\/LRNWebComponents\/hax-body\/blob\/master\/hax-store.html#L1016-L1017\n\n\nSo this may seem like an odd paradigm but its REALLY useful when you don't actually know the structure of the objects on the document (for example, elements in HAX registering when the document loads as to who actually can talk its language).\u00c2\u00a0https:\/\/github.com\/LRNWebComponents\/hax-body\/blob\/master\/hax-body.html#L288\n\n\nSo HAX data flow goes like this: there's a variable\u00c2\u00a0\"store\" \/\u00c2\u00a0state manager (hax-store) which all changing of global properties needs to consistently flow through that .write function (which the store keeps itself as a global namespace so then all calls to write the store are from that). The store, effectively writes itself, which then triggers a call to fire a consistent event saying \"a property has changed and here's its value\". Then, everyone else that cares (like hax-body in this example) has said so listen (at the document.body level) for any call of a property changing, and then it subsequently updates itself.\nThis is how you can have elements anywhere in the tree yet subscribing to events in a uniform, global way no matter the structure. Listen at the top, telephone back down to the element in question to handle the processing.\n"},{"id":"item-e165f124-11d5-4b9a-06ed-7b6bf1802ca8","title":"NGDLE is really just Enigma misspelled","location":"ngdle-is-really-just-enigma-misspelled","text":"I mean look at it!

My poking fun is in gest though, it's a complex idea and it at least evokes an important mental picture of \"things beyond the LMS matter... a lot\".\nAt Penn State, I've been fortunate to been building this weird thing called ELMS: Learning Network\n\n. It's an open source NGDLE and I started development prior to the term (fun fact\n\n). For those on the development team, NGDLE means Next Generation Distributed\n\nLearning Ecosystem\n\n.\nELMS:LN\n\nand the projects that make it up (it's actually a system of systems) seek to provide those mythical lego-grid-plates in the NGDLE picture. We provide some of the bricks out of the box to give you some ideas, but the real power is in the philosophy of design of the system. No matter what bricks you plug into the grid plate, you'll need a grid to keep it together and this is an attempt to be one of those grid plates.\nWe've been running courses via ELMS:LN\n\nsince 2014, so what does our vision of NGDLE look like? What does any of this actually mean\n\nor look like\n\nor do\n\n? Hopefully this will help. Let's start at the highest level and drill down from there to real things. (click to expand)\n\n\n\nNGDLE University to Faculty to Student relationships\n\n\n\n\nUniversities, Colleges and NGDL\nUniversity with the universe of apps that exist today\n\nBYU's University API\nFaculty member and their engagement with the universe\n\nInstructors and Instructional Designers\nSo we've got our integrations unified but what about where we all consume these things? LMSs, CMSs and portals all integrate with, build and present information differently. One plugs into Box \/ Google Drive, another doesn't. One talks LTI, the other less fluent. To TRY and simplify things we just said \"talk LTI vendors\" and many do, but there's way more that don't (and never will). So you go to different places for information (and your students do too) and you get a lot of cognitive load every time you have to learn something new just to put the file into one place vs another. Isn't there a better way to handle the consuming side of systems?\nImagine if we had a remote control for instructional system construction. If we could tell files where and how we want them available to users with minimal cognitive load. If it worked anywhere. In LMSs, CMSs, even desktop and mobile apps! Think of it like the Roku remote for education\n\n; stitching together a universe of separate \"channels\" into one unified interface while providing a standard way of presenting them.\nHAX - Headless Authoring eXperience\nHAX is short for Headless Authoring eXperience; which means that it can be integrated agnostic of any system! Think WYSIWYG editor but on steriods and built future focused (and actually WYSIWYG not Sorta-what-you-wanted-is-what-you-get). We've currently wired HAX into ELMS:LN\n\n, Drupal 6, Drupal 7\n\n, GravCMS\n\n, BackdropCMS\n\nand a desktop app\n\n. The goal isn't to stop there, it's just to illustrate that we can build an identical authoring experience across platforms utilizing the exact same code to do so.\nSo if we reach out and enhance our platforms that exist currently, but tie them into this \"HAX App eXchange\" grid plate; what does that look like?\nVisuals\nClick here to play with HAX\n\nIf I want to edit the way a video looks, I can click and modify it.\n\nPlacing a video in HAX\n\nSearch the HAX app exchange\n\nCustomize how a video is presented\n\n\nHow is this possible?!?\nHAX is built on Webcomponents\n\n. Webcomponents are changing the way people build things on the web. Imagine HTML but you could define your own tags.

What if we could tell the LMS we have an assignment (so we need a grade book entry) while simultaneously invoking a studio instruction space to be created for students to learn. What if we could say the things we wanted it to do\n\nand bring the technology to us instead of us to it!\n\n"},{"id":"item-c01a9db3-d74c-d8f9-c813-3c1bd61695a0","title":"Compartmentalizing","location":"compartmentalizing","text":"bitter sweet. 15 minutes spent creating things out of previous lego sets with my son made the entire day.

Woo. But they also present (literarily) a different space to occupy. If we view two locations as islands of thought. Different, separated by space; the bridge is the uniting force to get from A to B. In many spaces of thought we are presented with two options (or more but usually two primary options)\nPolitically, we see this with R********** and D********. Yes, Libertarian's exist (supposedly) but are marginal comparatively both financially and institutionally (and yes, I'm a Classical Liberal so..). However, why Classical Liberalism is shouted down or seen as foreign (see David Rubin or anyone else on New media that thinks outside the R\/D box) is because they occupy the bridge. In this realm, the bridge is literally just being ok with hearing each other's perspective (sad but yes).\nBridges are rarely the popular position to occupy. There's a whole series of rhetorical literature about the notion of bridges and the literary and philosophical implications of spaces which unite and connect disparate locals (thought or otherwise). Camps, cities, bodies of ideas that are consolidated, are largely the place that draw large groups of people. People like to be with other people, ideas are easier to binarily group together, and it's a lot easier to say I'm a ____ and dislike _____ or I support solution ____ vs ___.\nAs I get older, and my work spreads to more locals... I realize that I occupy the space. I tend to come into conferences which serve as small windows into worlds of A or B. Conferences consolidate people of a certain camp and so as someone who travels to many different camps, I always enjoy getting that window into a place where people consider themselves part of a camp.\nI present at\u00c2\u00a0Drupal camps (technical), DrupalCon (highly technical), education standards events (C levels in edu), instructional design events (low technical), liberal arts (non technical), webinars (moderately technical), Apereo (mid - high technical). So kind of all over the map as far as content, audience, and style. In this experience I've realized one thing is consistent: I never feel home.\nFor awhile, I really felt at home in the Drupal community. And while I don't feel like an outsider there, it's not able to relate to what I'm trying to ultimately do. Apereo is probably the place I feel most at home now, two years into attending and soon to be three, only because it's a mix of misfits that believe open source can change the world. So why do I feel so out of place. Well, in edtech forums, I realize that ever good idea I have is met with \"so now how can I buy this\" or \"how can I make money off this\" or \"how does this fit exactly what we've been doing\". It doesn't fit with change; and so much of what I \"push\" is change.\nEducational technology is really..interesting. I'd think it's amazing...except I live in different spaces. I see the Drupal community. I see truly amazing, brilliant technical infrastructure and design and see that shared openly. Then I come to the education space and I see modestly good ideas, modestly good architecture, but I see it sold as transformative...when it's not. This outsiderness leaves me feeling on the edges of both industries (highly technical and the space I'm supposed to occupy, edu).\nAnd so, I'm left with one feeling: Keep going, we're right. Every space we situate ourselves in seems to find what we're doing incredible, world view changing and different from what they've been [force] fed. In Drupal, we're counter culture. In Edu space, we're counter culture. So where are we just.. culture?! I don't know but it's interesting because it means we're finding a space that doesn't currently exist. By being a bridge, we're positioned to bring new ideas and new cultures into their word. It's a concept that I revel in, why I don't give up when we meet negativity, and why I think we constantly provide perspective that's much needed in A or B; because we're neither.\noriginally posted\u00c2\u00a024 May 2018\n"},{"id":"item-46aa6443-ebf1-62b2-6523-760490d5ce9b","title":"When Educators left the LMS","location":"when-educators-left-the-lms","text":"While not seeing it beyond previews and reviews, the movie When God left the building\n reviews an intreging concept: that people who leave the christian church are just leaving the building and pursuing God in ways that connect better with them. I bring this idea up because I see parallels with instructors and the building provided for them, the learning management system.\nAs someone who works on the side of building tools to escape the monotony; I can see both sides. Staff, instructional or otherwise, tend to want people to use the same thing. This helps from a support perspective; I mean, it's hard to support people in lots of tools, especially those unknown to the support staff. Faculty on the other hand, at times, want control and the freedom to use whatever they want in order to properly teach the subject in question.\nHow best to reach these people?\nIf we just funnel more functionality into a learning management system, they aren't coming back. Sometimes it's far more than just the fact that the LMS doesn't provide the capabilities they need; it's a fundamental distrust of a system who's three letter acronym invokes feelings of rage in many. It is also, even if unknowingly, a stand against authoritan system integrations (huh?\n).\nWhen a solution, any solution, is promoted by an organization as the one source of truth; some will naturally have an affinity towards literally anything else. The positioning of the system as the one and only, is a pure authoritarian stance; we must have control of this transaction (even if just in perception). Academia is built on the principle of exploration, academic freedom, and diversity. It has many libertarian and socialist leanings just in its positioning in society (education for all, freedom to explore and expand thought). These two forces; the deployment of centralized, singular solutions, is by default antithetical to the institutions which they are deployed within.\nSo what to do? Well, this is where I can confuse many at times since I'm perceived as having my own LMS (it's not but that's ok). Speaks directly to faculty\n: I want you to use whatever makes the most sense for you, that teaches your subject matter in the way that makes the most impact, and that doesn't cripple you financially or grading wise to utilize. Maximum freedom; what we produce or otherwise. However; where this stance differs is this: While the Church of LMS wants you to come back and retain membership as the one pathway to educational success. ELMS:LN spins off technologies into spheres outside of the traditional LMS church in order to meet you where it made sense for you.\nYou want to have your own content outside of any system? There's a project for that, and we'll make it easy to integrate afterwards. YOU are in control, we adapted to you. It's just a small part of why we build software completely outside of an LMS context which can build up the educational prowess of other solutions.\nTake our latest content authoring experience we've been working on - HAX\n. This is ELMS:LN's next generation authoring solution.... built entirely outside of ELMS; in fact at the moment, it's not talking to anything it's just a static website. Why? Let's cover just a few of the \"targets\" this can then radically transform into educational technology:\n\nAny CMS that integrates HAX (which currently Drupal 7, Drupal 8, Backdrop, and GravCMS are all on the roadmap)\n\nStatic webpages \/ single page demonstrations which can be identical in every way to the real thing\n\nDesktop publishing\n to do everything completely offline or via local development\n\nany LMS that wants to have an authoring experience second to none\n\n\nany tool that doesn't fit into those buckets or other solution that needs a flexible editor\n\nELMS:LN\n\nBy creating an authoring experience for the production of educational materials or otherwise (It's a really nice website builder at minimum), we can reduce the cost of producing a high quality webpage (it's doing 3D rendering in the browser w\/ VR I mean come on now!) and can also hook it up with all kind of meta-data that education needs (ala OERSchema\n). We can improve the quality of production, decrease cost of production, and do it in a uniform method no matter where it's been deployed. This is bringing church to people. It's connecting with them in the way they need because they have unique needs (snokeflake logo). It's the complete opposite stance of the LMS which says \"Integrate with me, I am the one great source of truth\".\nBecause much like the emptying buildings in the film, it's not that Educators left education, they just will start teaching and educating in other ways and in other places. Because when everything can be a learning experience, we no longer need a dedicated building to provide it to us.\n\n\n"},{"id":"item-8cef1ad3-7cc7-778a-b125-1d85f265742d","title":"The LMS is Cable, We are Roku. Expect Us","location":"the-lms-is-cable-we-are-roku-expect-us","text":"Cable\nIn the 40s and 50s, the Cable industry was born.\nBy the mid 60s it had almost a million subscribers. In the 70s and 80s the FCC regulated it heavily because of how much of an influence it had on the American consumer. Cable TV was everywhere by the 90s and currently more then 1\/2 of all households have cable based TV. It's a massive industry that's dominated by a handful of players. Those players are the brokers of what is allowed to appear on their listings and as channel options expanded, people increasingly felt like there's \"nothing on\". Still, a majority of people have it because of ease of access (hit the power button on TV and entertainment is there, 0 cognitive load).\nSound familiar? The Cable industry is very similar to the LMS industry. It's been around forever (since early 90s) and has been dominated by only a handful of players in the space. They effectively have a monopoly on the way that educational material is presented and transferred from instructor to learner. They control that pipeline and no matter how many channels (or LTI based apps) you have, everyone still complains there's \"nothing on\".\nCord cutting\nWhile you may have read the term in the news more recently, cord cutting has been a trend since the lat 2000s when Hulu and Netflix began their streaming services, allowing people to go \"over the top\" so to speak and skip cable while continuing to get information and entertainment. But it really hasn't taken off until recently? If there were options out there, why is it only now getting so much publicity? Hulu and Netflix have been around for about 9 years, why are the currently disrupting cable?\nEnter, the Roku\nRoku is a device that came out 2008 as a device for streaming Netflix and by 2010 starts to support other apps like Hulu and..well.. anyone that wanted on it. You see Roku had an open source SDK that effectively said \"if you implement this and notify us, you'll show up in our channel listing\". This allowed anyone that had media to stream access to peoples' homes that had a Roku box connected to a TV.\nOther reasons Roku was transformative from a user experience perspective:\n\nSingle box to attach to TV using existing standards (HDMI or RCA)\n\nApproachable input device (simple remote) with Power button activation via TV\n\nNo need to understand URLs after initial on-screen directions to setup an account\n\nIcons \/ images in big bright squares telling you what you are going to access\n\nStart watching \/ searching within that universe of media\nThe Roku has transformed the space because it took all those URLs that were always available for Netflix, Hulu, Youtube, Vimeo and the rest, and turned it into something that non-technical people could hook up in 5 minutes. The ease of use and approachability of the technology allowed it to start to decentralize and disrupt the cable industry (which as of this writing is in free-fall\n)\nThe LMS is Cable\n\nSo if the LMS is similar in positioning to Cable, how can we achieve our Roku moment where people decentralized and collapse the usage of the LMS (forcing it to transform how it behaves)? The industry has plenty of \"Hulu\" and \"Netflix\" counterparts in the form of systems that start to behave so much like something different that people adopt them in full and they start to look like LMSs of their own. Start with a video quiz tool, add badging, add certification, add a series of trainings, add quizzing, add rosters... HEY! This looks like an LMS (see: D\u00e2\u0080\u0099ARCY NORMAN effect\n).\nSo how do we build NGDLE solutions in such a way that they don't just become the next LMS which is trying desperately not to be an LMS, yet is, yet claims it's not... and the cycle repeats.\n\nNGDLE worldview\n\nThere has to be a way around the current dichotomy of Cable everyone hates and random URLs that have the things people want yet are too hard to use to reach mass adoption; and we're starting to build an attempt at it.\nIf your familiar with ELMS: Learning Network, a system with lots of individual systems interconnected, then when I say our Roku moment isn't actually ELMS you'll say Waaaaaah?!\nImagine ELMS:LN and it's suite of tools was mostly a backend, administrative functioning system. What if courses, studios, discussions, media and what not were viewed as individual apps on a Roku-esk interface geared towards education. Now, imagine traditional ELMS:LN \"apps\" are just some of the apps available and we instead showed everything that people could leverage, ELMS and otherwise.\n\nHAX, Education's Roku moment\n\nHAX (see other posts here) is short for Headless Authoring eXperience. Imagine though if you weren't just making a webpage though, you were actually constructing a course environment. Then imagine that you did all of this from your laptop, desktop or mobile device. What if a desktop app was your remote control for the construction of educational experiences\n. You can call those courses if you like, but the primary focus is on crafting an engaging, high fidelity experience and making it as easy as possible to do.\n\nHAX's \"apps\"\n\nHAX brings to the table two concepts that will provide us with our Roku moment our industry so desperately needs. Sources, and Gizmos (wtf?).\n\nSources\n\nA HAX Source is anything that has or can be given information, media, content, etc. If you are supplying that information, it would look like an upload field:\n\nUpload field in the Gizmo browser\n\n\nSo you would drag and drop a file to upload, let's say it's a .mp4 file. HAX would ask it's available sources who can handle video. Youtube and Vimeo and anything else would raise their hands. You'd select where you want the video to go and it would start uploading to that source.\n\nGizmos\n\nGizmos (architecturally webcomponents\n) in HAX are your way of presenting information visually. So we either supply media for a source (our .mp4 file) or we search and select one:\n\nSearch sources of information for content\n\n\nThe source says \"Hey, I've got something that looks like a video, can any Gizmos handle video\". Our Gizmos raise their hand as to who can display video, the user selects the Gizmo for the job:\nGizmo browser to select the right display for the job\n\n\nThen they are presented a form for filling in additional details:\nForm fields for configuring how to embed this\n\n\nAfter filling out the form, it'll get placed into the content and you can go about doing what you do best. Teach.\nVideo placed in the page\n\n\n\nDesktop app\n\nNow imagine if HAX were a desktop app\n, built using the same methodology as Roku where there are distributed apps that are all pulled together. Because of webcomponents and an awesome desktop builder called Electron, we can pursue both at the same time. We'll be able to improve the distributed building capabilities in ELMS:LN while also putting these capabilities in a desktop publishing app.\nThe app will then be able to write HTML which can work anywhere, with or without ELMS:LN \/ other sources, and then also have the ability to deploy to ELMS:LN's course delivery capabilities, or a static location, or a git repo, or any LMS.\nBy building LMS and system agnostic, we can deploy anywhere. In the coming months you'll start to see the Roku vision rolling out with additional accessibility, usability and integrations available.\nThe NGDLE will be built out of legos and deployed like Roku.\nWe are ELMS:LN\n.\nExpect Us.\n\n\n\n"},{"id":"item-6c53744c-1b33-97a1-976f-90484f5bc450","title":"Innovation's four ingredients","location":"innovations-four-ingredients","text":"I saw this picture at Disney's Test Track ride and had to take a picture. I love that the build up to this ride they have lots of (propaganda) pictures, prototypes and interviews with people about cars. What cars mean to them, what they represent in American culture, what they're experiences were with cars and why these designers got passionate about creating designs for new cars.\nWhile this is what Disney does to pass the time while waiting in a multiple hour line, this one stood out to me because while a Chevy commercial from start to finish, it was at least a cool and inspiring Chevy commercial. These four words had little descriptive signs to go with them early on in the ride (aka start of the line) which talked about the components to any new car or idea that they would come up with. I like these four concepts for building\u00c2\u00a0something new and wanted to bring them to our edTech world we build.\nLine\nDesigners start with an idea.\u00c2\u00a0 We get an idea from anywhere, maybe something we saw we liked or something we're reacting to that we didn't. No matter what the idea though it starts with jotting it down. Taking notes, reflecting (with lots of coffee and music) about what we could build. Writing and drawing are the first phase to bringing something new into existence.\nClay\nThen it's time to prototype the idea. We have to take it from sketches and, again with lots of coffee and music, bring that idea to reality on a screen. Maybe it's not the finished product, but it's enough of a sculpting of future reality that we can bring our vision to life in the eyes of someone attune to what we are expressing. The clay phase isn't finalized but it at least is semi-functional and allows us to get confirmation (or rejection) of the premise we're building against so that we can form it more fully later.\nMath\nNext after refinement as a block of clay it's time to take the idea and ensure it fits with the laws of physics. In edTech, our \"laws of physics\" is often constraints of delivering media on the web. Package size, dependencies on other existing things, extending our universe of tools to be as robust as possible without bloating it. Beyond this, our laws extend into actual laws like needing to account for accessibility and universal design.\nEmotion\nPassion for the car and what your building. We certainly align here and this word was really what lead me to want to write it down. If you don't have passion for what you're building, then you need to find some place that does bring you that satisfaction in life. We bring an undying passion to our work, knowing the creations we build are used to impact the minds of thousands. It's not easy designing future systems, especially not politically, but keeping in mind who we're here to serve makes it all worth it.\nYou can see emotion in what I write, I'm told it's visible in what I say in presentations too (though that's usually the coffee + coffee + music doing that). I've been told lately it's infectious and that's really good to hear; cause several years ago @btopro wasn't as well received or appreciated for enthusiasm.\u00c2\u00a0 When your outside the Overton window\n\n, people will reject what your saying. If you really do believe in what you're preaching, then it's on you not to try and change them (or you) but to change the way you message what you believe.\nSimple language changes can trigger a reaction of \"wow I see it that way now\" instead of \"what are you pushing now?\". Don't give up. Organizations want to remain at rest unless acted upon by an unstoppable force. Be that force of change in whatever you aspire to do.\n"},{"id":"item-401610da-127f-602f-5298-265f5eea00ee","title":"Straddling the Abyss","location":"straddling-the-abyss","text":"The tight rope walker\nHe looks to his left..\ncertain death.He tilts to the right, also, certain death.

Over correct too far and the entire thing comes to a stand still at best; at worst, the journey is over.\nI got to talk to my wife the other night before bed. It's intended as it sounds; rare lately. 2018 has been very busy for us. Lots of travel, lots of juggling schedules of kids, jobs, extra work on both our parts, and so as any parents of two young children know the conversation time without the noise of life is often rare. It was in this moment that I used a phrase I haven't fully explained previously.\nIt\u00c2\u00a0was that of where my work is heading and the creeping abyss that I see myself needing to avoid. She asked what I meant by having to approach the abyss (in reference to our\u00c2\u00a0work and where it's going). I'm not really one to bring conversations that are really personal in matter up in a public form but if none speak that which is abnormal then all that remains is what others claim as normalcy.\nEveryone is miserable at the top\nSo how can we get to the top without becoming miserable in the process or losing our soul? I have yet to meet anyone or hear of anyone (but one person) who has done the whole parable of the fisher thing and not ended up the same as they left off. The parable is a man is fishing by a lake and someone says \"wow you're really good at this, you should form a company and sell these fish to others\". And so he either relates the following or lives it but basically it goes\u00c2\u00a0that if you stop doing what you love just because you love it and turn it into a financial enterprise, you had better make sure you never lose sight of that love or you'll risk it just becoming another job. A job the fisherman wants to ultimately escape and go back to sitting by the lake and fishing alone.\nWithout having to detail who these people are (nor should I) I can sadly tell you that most people I've met that run open source projects that have taken off are often broken people. Maybe I just know the wrong ones, but so many fall to the social ills that plague us all yet are even easier to come by when money and \"power\" come into play. Drugs, sex, broken homes, distance from family and friends, unfulfillment\u00c2\u00a0in the life's work they have selected.\u00c2\u00a0If these weren't common\u00c2\u00a0problems in our space you wouldn't see so many conference talks about topics of Burn out, imposter syndrome and generally being a person outside of tech.\nThis, is the abyss. Fame. Vanity. The whole lot of the typical \"7 deadly sins\" as it were. This is the abyss that from day one I've recognized and made sure never to cross over. It doesn't mean I don't have fun at events, it doesn't mean I don't have friends in the communities I partake. But it does mean that I'm always in control of myself and any situation I'm a part of. I can't let go, and I won't; even if it seems I'm there in my mind I've carved out a safe place to hide.\nNever get so deep into your work that you forget why you were doing the work in the first place. Never proceed through life without purpose, vision, intention, desire, love, hope or dreams. Find your why, embrace it and never let go. It seems silly, but finding your Why, having guiding principles and living them are what separate a fulfilling life from an empty one.

My Why's are simple, solid, and core to my being\nBecause my (and your) children deserve a better world then the already pretty awesome one I was given\nBecause we can always do better\nBecause education raises all ships and allows us to bring greater understanding and joy to this world as a result\nBecause money isn't everything\nBecause with great power, comes great responsibility.\nBecause this is my calling.\nAlways have something to look up to, something to chase, and a hero\n\n\n"},{"id":"item-f82147b6-1844-d3c0-9515-01130ce85c79","title":"The Knowledge Decentralization Manifesto","location":"the-knowledge-decentralization-manifesto","text":"Access to knowledge is a control system.\nAs the \"Apple of Eden\n\" unlocked the power to question so too is the case with all modern knowledge transfer technologies. Knowledge corrupts established thought, expands horizons, and changes human outcomes in powerful ways. It has network effects of its own and so, it is imperative that we as producers and orchestrators of knowledge production, management and dissemination acknowledge the power we wield. We have the power to shape society. So how best can we utilize our talents to maximize empowerment?\nIt is an ethical imperative that we seek the fundamental transformation of higher education to maximize quality and access to knowledge\n. This transformation will empower the globe to increase empathy, maximize personal freedom and personal growth through increased educational equality.\nChange knowledge dissemination; change everything.\nWe will build a more open, more accessible, more equal opportunities, and as a result a more just society through the empowerment of all regardless of background, experience, status or financial means. What structural problems must we attack in order to fundamentally alter the dissemination and production of knowledge? What philosophy of system design can we adopt in order to change structural inequality?\nActor network theory\n offers a critical lens with which to view production and implementation of knowledge dissemination technologies. TLDR; all machines and human connections influence one another equally and their relative positioning to one another is important. Simply using a tool is not enough, the tool must provide affordances that eliminate structural inequality in knowledge production and dissemination.\nTo illustrate that there is a difference in possibilities through knowledge dissemination usage\nA, B contrasting knowledge dissemination and learning environment management\n\nAll knowledge is produced by accessing website X. All knowledge seekers access website X.\nA counter to this approach is similar in initial access but maximizes flexibility and potential quality of experience\nAll knowledge is produced in any location that best meets its needs (Solution Y), then referenced in website X. All knowledge seekers access website X, but are pushed out to website Y.\nDecentralization of knowledge construction\nThis decentralization of knowledge construction still affords the minimal amount of centralization required to avoid chaos, which I shall deem structured anarchy\n. The point of decentralizing knowledge production is not to produce chaos, it is to provide more vibrant, local options to better meet the needs of knowledge producers based on the topic of choice. We don't setup science lab classes expecting to teach forestry in them. We don't expect our doctors of tomorrow to learn while dangling from a tree harness.\n\nWhy then should it be absurd to construct technology environments that best meet the needs of the topic at hand?\n\n\nSeeding this ground, that all learning environments and knowledge production silos are the same, forces us to accept structural failings of today's learning management systems which better resemble a theocracy then today's vibrant internet culture. These structural failures lead to simple technical ones that are difficult for modern knowledge produces to understand (yet are forced to accept)\nA typical cycle produced by lack of empowerment\n\n\nWant to improve engagement with learners and knowledge seekers? No, the theocracy doesn't allow JavaScript.\n\nWant to improve perception of knowledge quality through design? No, the theocracy demands understanding of complex technical underpinnings.\n\nWant to reference or pull in external knowledge? Yes, but only if it follows our ridged, dated orthodoxies of API design.\n\n\nThere's another way out.\nA phrase has emerged (circa 2014) to attempt to encompass the antithesis of the theocratic knowledge production market. Next Generation Digital Learning Environments (NGDLE)\n is thought of as the response to legacy theocratic knowledge dissemination technologies. NGDLE embraces knowledge construction by leveraging a free and open internet as well as the construction of new learning ecosystems. It seeks maximal freedom for knowledge producers to utilize whatever methods of production they can access in order to best disseminate knowledge to those seeking it.\nThe theocratic knowledge production market has attempted to utilize existing methods of structural inequality in order to perpetuate their control in the name of next generation. It utilizes legacy standards like Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) in order to claim that it has embraced the internet by providing a window out to it.\n\nVisualizing LTI Entrapment\n\n\n\"Look at us, we've changed. No really, we have. We allow you\n to access (some) additional methods of construction. Just stay with us, please, we've changed.\" the theocratic knowledge production market says. Like an abusive lover though, it hasn't actually changed, it's just gotten a haircut and bought flowers (or, you know, adopted Twitter's bootstrap framework and claimed the high ground of usability as a result).\n\nTheocratic knowledge production market where it really is, where it claims, and then where NGDLE and my projects attempt to take society\n\n\nThe knowledge production theocracy wants you; needs you; no, demands that you stay in a stasis.\nBut you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need them\nNGDLE is not about building up a long dead, one sided relationship (and ideology). It's an approach that says we need to tell the LMS that \"we're cool, we've moved on. We can still be friends though\". I mean, LMS still has all your CDs in its car and you can't just leave 40 or 50 CDs in LMS's car right? No, don't abandon your CDs in LMS's car; I'm saying though that we need to consider how we can make LMS useful the best self it can be too. The LMS was never meant to do too much, but we previously demanded that it do so. Like every Disney villain, they aren't purely evil, the theocratic knowledge production market is just misguided. It's going where capitalism has allowed it to go and needs a purely decentralized, internet mindset in order to right the (sinking) ship.\nNGDLE more than technology construction is about aligning the foundational principle of academic freedom with technology freedom. While the theocratic knowledge production market provides and enforces bland experience construction; NGDLE by contrast fosters personal growth, seeking new idea and expanding horizons through the intentional decentralization of knowledge production and dissemination.\n\nA network of solutions across the wider internet\n\n\nThis is why NGDLE has been so difficult for anyone to embrace (or build for that matter...ELMS:LN is 4 years old and only now is making sense in discussions I have or slides). NGDLE is not a product. It is a mindset, a method of knowledge assembly that ensures no centralized authority can exist. Without centralization, it's very difficult for the theocratic knowledge production market (as it presently exists) to make money. And if it's purely profit driven (spoiler alert: they don't care about you no matter how big their conference, they want your money).\nBringing the market to succumb to NGDLE\nIf the market existed, then capitalism alone would provide it right? We've been asking for these products and the theocratic knowledge production market provided. To which I'd retort... when Toys R Us existed and we all went to a centralized location to buy toys, did we sit around and think \"huh, there's gotta be a way we can get rid of this process and provide better outcomes\". I mean, the market produced a solution to a need, we utilized it, so it was clearly the best (I mean they had a run for 70+ years).\nSome will argue the market caught up with them (Amazon specifically) but what really happened? Amazon embraced a decentralized access methodology, aka internet centric access and development method. By increasing pressure in the server and supply chain automation space they were able to collapse the theocratic toy purchase market.\nForces to support which will decentralize the theocratic knowledge production market\nSupport these efforts, and we collectively can disrupt the theocratic knowledge production market\n\nPaul Hibbits Course Hub GravCMS project\n\n\nReclaim hosting - Domain of One's Own\n\n\nTsugi\n\n\n\nStand up for voices that are attacking the theocratic knowledge production market and are using their money and their feet to demonstrate their commitment to ending it. Paul's work illustrates the power of the individual to get up and leave and not fail. Reclaim hosting is an example of how an edge industry and further erode confidence in the theocratic knowledge production market. Tsugi is a representation of how we can micro service the theocratic knowledge production market into a position where you start questioning why you have an LMS. I will say that as I'm far more aggressive in my NGDLE stance then Dr. Chuck, his technology embraces the theocratic knowledge production market too much and will ensure that it always exists.\nI am a hardline NGDLE believer. I am change. I am a Tempored Radical\n. As a result, the fronts that I push on and will continue to push on are far more decentralized then these approaches. All three of the above empower people... to continue to use the theocratic knowledge production market over the long term. They build up their users for sure, but in any social declaration of where we can go, someone needs to try and be the goal post.\nStory of the arbiters of the digital revolution\n\nStory of the arbiters of the digital revolution - Ex Uno Plura\n\n\nThese represent my own efforts to bring about the decentralization of knowledge production in order to Transform Education.\n\n#HAXtheweb\n - Decentralized, OER Schema aware knowledge construction platform. Run an identical authoring experience regardless of platform and leverage the web as a whole. Work on a desktop, a phone, locally, in a CMS, in an LMS? Doesn't matter. HAX is intended to be a decentralized production system which makes writing complex HTML trivial. It's also engineered to allow developers to extend the authoring experience by simply extending the web (through web component based architecture, ala LRN Web components below).\n\nELMS:LN\n - ELMS: Learning Network - A system of systems, built with NGDLE in mind. It is engineered to power HAX (and HAX power it). It provides methods for environment construction so that educators can have more vibrant learning ecosystems rather then single widget-y + 1 tools. ELMS:LN pulls all of these technologies and grows in capabilities as elements make it possible. It is both experiment and development platform for testing new pedagogical idea as they relate to design as well as delivering higher quality experiences then traditional LMS can produce.\n\nLRN Web components\n - LRN Web Components is an ever expanding design and functionality component set that powers ELMS:LN, HAX and any system that we develop. It allows for an insane amount of reuse across educational projects and is intended to solve the NGDLE problem of cognitive load on learners via design and development consistency making environments easier to use and develop.\n\nOER Schema\n - Schema for expressing pedagogy. It extends Schema.org and provides semantic meaning to all of the elements produced as part of LRN Web Components, meaning that every system (edtech or otherwise) that implement LRN Web Components will be getting wired for OER Schema. This will provide a more vibrant search and remix experience for OER content produced over the long haul of society.\n\n\n\nUX Normalization visual relative to LRN \/ HAX\n\n\n\nExample of two different courses leveraging similar UX conventions\n\n\nI'll see you in the future.\nWe can develop in minutes what takes the establishment months to envision. When we give these technologies away. When we work with faculty person to person to empower them not to stand on our shoulders but to stand on their own, completely independent of us (via HAX). There is no limit to what we can do when we start working together.\nI will be told that I'm full of myself, and often have, and that's fine. But if Hawkings felt he couldn't be better than Einstein he never would have tried. If it wasn't an active journey to be the best, to liberate the most, . I can pledge to you now, whoever you are, that you have a critical role to play in the future development of educational technology solutions and helping improve structural inequality, if you want to.\nI'm standing up, and I won't back down from these ideas, technologies, and approaches. My heroes are probably a little different than yours. My heroes are people like Jonas Salk\n, inventor of the Polio vaccine that refused to patton it. Like Dr. Charles R. Severance\n who's crazy enough to believe in a communication's protocol so deeply that he'd get tattoos of those that implemented it (as an LTI founder and me viewing LTI as evil, we're a fun party pack). Like Richard Stallman\n who is unapologetic in his adherence to open source and free software. And all those that donate their time and efforts in order to empower others to build solutions for themselves.\nI've passed up money, promotions, companies, consulting, time with loved ones (the big picture is a better future for my boys); because of an idea which I know to be true: any individual can change the world. I will change whatever educational equity issue I can resolve in my life time, or will at least work as hard as I can towards attempting to resolve those issues. I've been blessed with an amazing opportunity in this world... to write code that I can release in hopes of making an impact. I know that if you'd join us and do the same, that we can improve access, increase quality, and eliminate the need for anyone to be dependent on anyone else to disseminate knowledge.\nWill you join me in trying to be more than just a vapor in this world but to leave a legacy as the people that stood up and caused a social movement that saw a dramatic improvement in education and knowledge production systems? Through better solutions, people will be able to better empathize with one another, have a bigger world view, and reduce real world conflicts. Through better solutions we'll get knowledge out to people in faraway places and disadvantaged nearby ones that build people up and teach them how to fish on their own. That give them untold experiences without the need to take on hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt.\nEx Uno Plura - Out of one, many.

They said that while their higher ups would look at a problem and say why are we building what we can just buy; but that as they see it, the real question should be when it's this easy to build, why would you ever buy? (paraphrasing) \"It's not even a question of buy, you can't buy this\".\n\n\n\nIt's not even a question of buy, you can't buy this\nI'm happy to say the \"this\" in question was effecitvely NGDLE based solutions that were being presented as delivered through a certain system I may be rather fond of.

He said (relative to us rolling out a course need) \"Ya but does it scale\". To which I countered \"If it doesn't is it not worthy of meeting a need?\" Let's align these dicotomies. You in the buy crowd. You in the scalability crowd. In the educational technology establishment... Do you really think we need your 10 year old solutions packaged as new to our administration? Do you think, over the long haul (we'll say 2-3 years) that we collectively need you in order to present our ideas online, in the classroom, all around?\nWhat rock do you hide under when we destroy a simple assumed data point: That corporations provide scale and stability that individuals cannot. To build vs buy then, this presumes that the individual is never going to be as powerful as the collective. It seeds control from how things SHOULD be done to teach most effectively to simply what pure capitalism can provide.\n\n\n\nPure Capitalism to subgigate education\nNow, without getting into my incredibly complex political views that no one can figure out (let's keep it that way). I. Heart. Capitalism. Capitalism has pulled countless civilizations and people out of crippling poverty and generated the insane (good and bad) society we have today. However, unfeddered capitalism, especially in regulated spaces (electricity, education, government) is a dangerous thing. When there are no rules or a space does not yet exist; yes, pure capitalism all the way, let's make this a thing. When there are intense rules, regulations, etc; you allow capitalism to consume a market and prevent it from ever escaping an oligopoly\n (credit to colleague @nikkimk\n for enlightening me on this construct).\n\n\n\nUnleashing systemic decentralization\nPointing to some past writings on this topic before starting into a new one (I'm just a better writer now, my soul has not changed):\n\nUnification vs Fragmentation of the LMS\n (2011)\n\nEnvisioning the LMS-less university\n (2011)\n\nThe post LMS era: Suite of Tools learning networks\n (2013)\n\nWill you be in business next century?\n (2015)\n\n\"Universities can't make software\"\n (2017)\n\nDDOSA\n (2017)\nSo.

And the shop-keep would say \"here you are, please write a check for $79.95 and you can have your 8 floppy disks to do the install, can I get you a storage case for those after you've done the install?\"\nSo after you bought Word, you could take it home and install for several hours. But eventually, Word, text editors were no longer profittable. You don't have to buy Word in order to get a quality text editor, they are abundant. What happened? #theinternet.

Users decentralized from a solution space by leveraging a multitude of options. It was no longer feasible for big M to sustain pure capitalist ideals (we made the text editor, you now can enter text and be a business person, har har har) and so the model collapsed.\nWikipedia is a similar example when it comes to Encyclopedia Britanica (print version of the whole damn world's knowledge as currated by like 10 doods probably) or Microsoft Encarta CD-ROM (again, but instead of print slightly more interactive and on CD - Read Only Memory).

Transform, or be transformed. The next post will be about my plan to transform education in the next few years through intentional application of decentralized solutions and local empowerment. Through decentralization, we will\n eliminate the need for crony capitalist endpoints in educational institutions (like LMSs) to continue to tie our hands and prevent the innovation we need to survive the coming societal transformation in the transfer of knowledge.\n"},{"id":"item-79649f12-a6d2-98f5-3c0b-8b88f2a24457","title":"HAX apereo piece","location":"hax-apereo-piece","text":"Once you see HAX, and realize how it works, you won't be able to unsee it. What is HAX? HAX is short for Headless Authoring eXperience; meaning that we've decoupled the authoring of content and media from any backend storage system. This frees us to build the best authoring solution for the web. Not specifically for ELMS:LN, or Sakai, or Tsugi but for the web in general. HAX does this through a front-end technology called web components. Web components have been in the pipeline of the web for many years, but the time is finally right to start jumping on board and planning for how to use them in the future. Web components in short are a four part specification already in most browsers fully (or polyfill-ed in) which allows for the creation of new, custom html tags that the browser recognizes. This nets you modular \/ component driven development without the need for bloated frameworks like Angular, React, etc. HAX leverages this technology to build a form of web components authoring web components. This means that we can build new custom elements that any browser understands, and have it fire up a single JSON object and IF hax is around it will understand how to build a UI for it. HAX based content will never appear to have been made with HAX, because it's just writing data into web component properties the same way any developer could. This means faculty can start authoring advanced HTML without ever looking at it. It also means we as developers can build and expand our systems using open standards without frameworks limiting who can plug and play where. The #usetheplatform movement is lively and is ultimately the replacement for all frameworks or at least huge chunks of them while allowing us to share visual and functional assets.

I am about to embark on a delicious journey. A journey of mind altering chemicals pour perfectly at home. A journey, into @DeathWishCoffee\n\nI remember as a child, and seeing the tools of my father or grandfather's workshop and thinking \"wow... how did they amass all those tools\" and they'd tell me \"one at a time son. One at a time\" (this is not my reality this was stolen from Gran Torino). Today. I have my toolshed\nThe difference, is my toolshed is stocked with what assembles the perfect cup of coffee. Let me tell you, how to experience the perfect cup of Saturday afternoon coffee (I should NOT be drinking this this late in the day I'll be up for days).\nFirst. A gallon bottle of distilled water and a packet of @thirdwavewater\n . Mix the two. Then get clear 20 oz coffee cup and fill it with the water almost to the top. Now get a @BonavitaWorld\n tea kettle with a digital readout and pour the water into it. Add 1 oz for steam loss\nNext take out an @aeropresscom\n coffee maker and @DeathWishCoffee\n . Put 5 scoops (small scooper) of death wish into a grinder of your choice (I have a 14$ proctorsillex by @HamiltonBeach\n). Pulse grinder till beans are just above expresso level grinded.\nStart the Bonavita set at 195 degrees and select the hold setting. You want 195 not 195 then cool off to 193 or some other garbage temperature. Using the inverted pour method (described here\n) pour the beans in and then slowly pour water.\nLet sit for 1 min ensure you've filled to the 3.5 line in the aeropress. After 1 min, apply \"the btopro method\" which is to press coffee to the 3 line (so .5 lines) to obtain suction, then slowly pull up on the brewer pump. (wwwhhaaaaa you say?)\nhttps:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/91fEJqgdsnu4E\nIf successful, you will be able to pull air up from the cup through the filter without it moving, keeping a seal with the beans so that nothing leaks through but air pulses through the upper portions of the bean mash. This maximizes flavor... big time.\nafter plunger reaches the top of the cup, stop and press down to the 1.5 line. Then slowly pull the plunger back up, and add additional water. Continue doing this until you've used all the water in the Bonavita; ensuring that you keep the temp at 195 the whole time\nPress till your cup is full; hopefully being able to run out of water and press all the way to the bottom. The last 5% the press can go down will pull extra oils out of the coffee beans (and believe me, with @DeathWishCoffee\n you'll want the oils). And now, 1 last step (whhaaaa?)\nhttps:\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/tu54GM19sqJOw\nGet ANOTHER cup of similar size (or slightly larger), and slowly pour your full cup of coffee into this one until you hit about 95% empty. Very, slowly pour this last amount and you'll be able to trap any excessive sediment added via \"the btopro method\" and discard.\nAnd now. You have the ultimate cup of home brewed coffee. Perfect for enjoying while the kids are napping and you write an excessively long series of tweets about how you typically spend 15 minutes making a cup of coffee much to the critique of everyone you know and love.\nFin.\n"},{"id":"item-fd7f3b3e-edbb-ea0f-fc85-717973f49cb0","title":"Watch the ripples and you'll miss the waves","location":"watch-the-ripples-and-youll-miss-the-waves","text":"\n  \"I don't understand why you give this stuff away, it's worth a lot. I mean screw capitalism, yea I get it I mean right there. But Universities pay a lot of money for these things. Why make them for free? How does that get you rich\"\n\n\nIt's not the first time it's come up, though this was definitely a more direct line of questioning then is typical. It's these promptings though that convince me [sic] that we live in a simulation, or at least that I am. Nothing else could explain why these mile markers are placed in my path except divine intervention (which a simulation would surely be someone more powerful then us placing the VR googles on the Matrix bodies; but to be less silly...)\nWe are reaching a critical inflection point in the near future. The point of singularity where I don't know where the road goes. It's one thing to project in 2015 the things we'd be working on by 2020. It's another to present an idea and call it Structured Anarchy about the systematic messiness of application development in institutions (education being just one). And.. it's an entirely different feeling and experience living the pieces falling into place. Seeing the alliances and relationships form, feeling the momentum (of what?) and the hair on the back of your neck stand up in disbelief that things could keep going the way they have been going. As we progress, let me assure you of one thing:\n\n\n\nThis was all according to plan.\n\nSee, it's like the human genome project. It takes years of effort to get the first 1% done and then after that a long time but less so to get to 2%. Then, after hitting that critical theashold (whatever it is, 10% we'll say) the rest is finished in a matter of weeks. How is this possible? There are 100 things and you did 10 in x time, the other 90 will surely take x*9.\nIt's because programming (and deprogramming in the case of genome) can stack and repurpose knowledge and capabilities. Unlike lifting 100 boxes one at a time into a truck, with patterned software development once we lift 1 box we've liften 10. And once we lift 10 boxes we now can lift 100. The pattern of exponential growth in capability to solve problems is because of the field itself. You solve one problem in a modular way, you roll out the modular way in a pattern, and now you've got an exponential amount of capability just in that one problem space. Now modularly solve the next, and the problem those create, and combine these solutions to solve that one. Suddenly your exponential capabilities are solving things exponentially.\nIt doesn't happen over night. These things take a very, very long time to develop. When I think back to the first outline designer I made it's hilarious. I \"knew javascript\" enough to slap some code together; but I couldn't make new code. I couldn't design things well beyond what I could do in MS paint. I didn't have version control. I didn't have a method of getting feedback and testing aside from hitting refresh tons of times.\nNow, I saw a huge aspect of the problem space solved in a single day. Is it because we already built that and now know what it is? Partly yes, past knowledge of the problem helps frame future solutions for sure. But the libraries and techniques we can now leverage mean that when we solve 1 problem (say... a button design) we're now solving that \"problem\" in every future project we take on. In this way, things that once took weeks and months of development (I'm not talking planning \/ ideating, coding, typing things, testing, etc) now can be done in hours and days.\nThis is because our backend modularity and pattern based design now has a place on the front-end thanks to Webcomponents. Now we can pattern based deploy our modular front-end assets. Meaning that when we make a button better, we've made them all better. Meaning that when we need to build a new thing, the button can be assumed. Now button sounds small (and it is) but let's replace button with modal, card, menu, block, layout, grid system, navigation pattern, form entry method, json data loading, ANYTHING. ANY. THING. If we can build it as a component then we can repurpose it into others. This almost doesn't feel like coding based on how coding has felt the last 10 years, this feels like building things with legos (and I looooooved legos growing up).\n\n\n\nTiny things\nSo while we trickle out small pieces (a outline\n, a grid system\n, a PDF\n, a mp3 player\n, a video player\n, a gallery\n, the list goes on) that's not really what we're building. These are just by-products of our new found capabilities. We don't have just these either. We've got 122 repos of these little pieces\n and these are just the ones we've shared so far. When we get into full on apps (powering parts of elmsln) there are another 10 full on headless applications that are running there.\nThese little pieces; these little things. While we've been putting out these ripples (and some are very cool\n) I implore you not to focus on them. But look out a bit further and see the tidal wave that's brewing. A wave which I assure you, is coming a shore soon.\n"},{"id":"item-40122e25-5673-4544-133f-2acb042dbb23","title":"I challenge you to Transform Education; together","location":"i-challenge-you-to-transform-education-together","text":"Institutions and employees within them will remain at rest unto acted upon by an internal or external force. Externally, this is the preasures of society, markets and learners demanding change. Internally, this is tempored radicals within the machine knowing the machine needs to change. But change is more complex then that, because preasures for change and the path toward change are not linear. It also means those with motivations to not remain at rest will exponentially increase in their ability to not stay at rest. One innovation after immense frustration kicks off dozens as opposed to one leading to one more.\n\n\n\nThe Btopro Flow of Educational Innovation\n\n\nIn my spectrum of educational innovation, I place Ease of the staff to manage on the same axes as frustration. Something is either easy or difficult, not much to note there. Vertically we see Sameness and Innovation. Now, The easier something is, the more the same it will remain. Once we've transitioned a technology to a resting state, say ethernet cable in the walls for Fiber connectivity, then we'd like it to remain the same and be easy to maintain (I know network engineers will say it's actually frustrating as hell and the same but let's imagine here). Once that technology is at rest and stabilized, we really don't want there to be innovation in that space.\nInnovation, both it's pursuit and what it takes to pursue, is a different animal. Innovation forces the individual and the organization to strive toward frustration. Frustration and perserverence lead to growth. For example, backend application development is very difficult at first. But once one masters MySQL and PHP (as examples), and then masters Ubuntu (operating system); now, the frustration subsides and the exponential inversion of the frustration, arching towards innovation can occur. And not just occur, but do so at scale.\n\n\n\nVirtualization\nAnother example. Now that you've mastered PHP\/MySQL to make the underpinnings of an application. And Ubuntu for it to ride on. Learning Docker and doing something meaningful with it is relatively trivial. Using knowledge of Docker, you can virtualize and deploy the once impossibly complex and frustrating task, an infinite number of times. Your command of 1 application was greater effort then the now command of 1000s. And this, from an organizational perspective, is what leads to transformation.\n\n\n\nThe pathway to transformation\nWhat process are you engaged in now that will keep things the same? Is it reliance on legacy solutions? Perhaps staffing that \"won't get us there\" (whatever there is). Then it's possible you should accept your sameness and relegate the easy, stationary tasks to those that work there now. You must achieve stability with those best suited for stability. (note the bold) This is also an incredibly important function of any organization. Without sameness, without ease of management, you do not have an organization to manage.\n\nBut the process of transformation of practice, of digging in and fundamentally enhancing what was frustrating into what is now easy (and eventually the same even if previously infinitely difficult) is a different task. It's not the same. It's not better, it's not worse. There may be more conferences to submit to and it might have more \"glory\" as we as humans tend to glorify and appreciate different and new more then old and stable. However, these are two very different car engines : innovation, and sameness.\n\n\n\nTwo engines\nIt's critical that we as bringers of the new digital revolution realize this. If we are to bring our institutions into the future, we need a different set of engines in order to do so. You don't replace the HVAC system with a next generation HVAC system while maintaining the current one. You maintain the current one, explore new ones, and then when the time is right, start to make the switch. We need to focus our organizations on the future and dedicate thought leadership and technical expertise specifically toward that\n. Where are we going is just as critical as having those maintain where we collectively are now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunsplash-logo\n\n\n\nAna Gabriel\n\n\n\n\nunsplash-logo\n\n\n\nWes Carpani\n\n"},{"id":"item-1851779a-7fe1-2fa1-ddd5-0a926467a3e3","title":"NGDLE, OER, Cost reduction, accessibility and Decentralization: the future of our institutions.","location":"ngdle-oer-cost-reduction-accessibility-and-decentralization-the-future-of-our-institutions","text":"I'm done with talk about the Next Generation Digital Learning Environment; it's time for action. I have had a plan for laying out the future of technology in higher education that I've formulated since my early work on ELMS: Learning Network, a platform now 4 years old that has roots planted as an initial idea 10 years ago. It's not just a technology solution, it's had years of planning and fostering the ideals that it's been imbued with.\nAs a result, I'll discuss some efforts into NGDLE, what they propose to look like and why I have personally reframed my thinking from Digital to Distributed; as in Next Generation Distributed Learning Ecosystem. This will be directed at non-technical audiences and why these efforts will transform how we all do our work if we all start moving the same direction philosophically.\nYou see, NGDLE is not just a solution, it's a philosophy of technology design intentionally implemented. This is a vision that I am implementing with every line of code we contribute to ELMS:LN. ELMS:LN is far more then a technology platform, it's a mindset. That we are all unique.\nFaculty, staff, administration, students, especially in the online realm, are all distributed. Either distributed in skill set or organizationally or in how we deliver our courses and instruction to students. One thing is central to each of us though; us. We are individuals.\nSo, as individuals that live on distributed laptops, smartphones, and IoT construction; why is it that our technology deployments in education still mirror the Cathedral as opposed to the Bazaar? The individuals of the organization produce things for the institution in a distributed manner yet are forced to consolidate efforts among a few applications at a few locations in the name of consistency.\nThis is the Distributed Ecosystem piece of what I call NGDLE where I need CIOs and management to understand the network affects of this worldview. I am calling for the intentional, decentralization of application access and consumption on the part of our user base (Faculty, staff, students). This decentralization better mirrors individuals and will be met with less resistance then remotely affixed addresses and applications everyone must go to in order to engage with.\nThe LMS is 1 obvious target for decentralization, but what does that look like? How is that even possibly manageable at scale? Without rewriting a blog post outright (https:\/\/btopro.com\/blog\/the-lms-is-cable-we-are-roku\n), I equate our NGDLE efforts to Roku while LMS solutions are stuck in the Cable TV days (of which most people are cord cutting to escape as much as possible).\nIf we took this concept and expanded upon it; let's say we were trying to build \"Roku\", a distributed, small stitching platform where individuals plugged an item into their TV (app on laptop \/ phone \/ desktop), had minimal setup (Roku does 1x two-factor authorizations binding the app to the user); what would it look like? How would it function? What would it transform in our process and development as institutions? Our sharing? Our ability to discover and produce OER.\nImagine having an App for your institution that stitched together all of the services available to the user in order for them to leverage the institution to it's fullest. Instead of training every faculty on what's possible, where things are in the organization, and then constantly blasting emails to update and HOPE people realize the system we jus paid $200,000 for is actually known about to be used, what if they had an App that gave them a small notice that now they had access to this item in their ecosystem.\nImagine if ANYONE could use an interface on their local machine of choice to author highly accessible, interactive, engaging and OER tagged material without the need for any technical knowledge. Just pick up the app, start clicking and you are authoring engaging educational experiences. What if that material was then in a format that could be imported anywhere? What if it saved to Box and other solutions we already have and leveraged development technologies in order to keep that information discoverable and sharable. What if instead of having to go out and look for OER and other media to remix into teaching and learning, that material came to us on our App and we could easily ingest it.\nSo yes. It's not conjecture, that's what we're building this and it is open source. It's also being engineered in such a way that it has no requirement of using ELMS:LN and it's already usable enough to illustrate the concept across multiple platforms locally as well as on the web in CMSs.\nThis talk will be more about philosophy of technology development and how it will impact the institution and make it a more open place then actual technology. The ELMS:LN platform and our \"Roku remote\" we're building called HAX will be mentioned but I will not be going into developer deep dives (that's actually a different talk specific to developers).\n\n"},{"id":"item-4080a73d-360e-7a65-131b-705b8c6169e7","title":"Actually, curing edtech","location":"actually-curing-edtech","text":"I read an article recently by Educause Review\n and I wonder if your able to pick up on what I did.

It's situated somewhere between socialist utopia (Everyone has access maaaan\n) and capitalist utopia (Everyone competes and knowledge is part of that competition). And you address concerns of \"Weeellll it seems like these technology vendors have no real foundation in education \/ instructional principles\" with the equivalent of the \"meh\" emoji followed by a hands up in the air?\nI read this article and went off on a total drill down rant on twitter (unfortunately against someone who's an edtech provider and he wasn't the target it just sorta happened that way). They for once, finally, omg finally identify the problem: That edtech producers don't work in Education and have almost no clue wtf they are doing other then making something shiny. There is little to no research behind what they do. AND THEY ARE PURELY PROFIT DRIVEN\n.

A bunch of students said \"blackboard sucks\" and threw something together rather quickly which is superior to it. Think for a second then... why can't we collectively do the same? NO! \n\nWhy can't we do better then that?\n\nIf you want to stop edtech driving us around collectively and being part of the techno-centric worldview that forces education to be more about money then learning, then you've gotta defeat this narrative. I view our team and those we collaborate with as being among the first to plant that flag in the ground. We are educators, trainers, designers, technologists, students, learners, and administrators all working together with a singular purpose to solve this problem. We are going to deliver solutions that are not profit motive driven, that are more open, more accessible, have research backing\n, and are ultimately better then anything you will see produced external to education.\n\nDon't believe it?\n\nWatch us!

How can it be balanced? I need to make a living, you need to make a living, professors, teachers, etc - @lastmjs\n\nIt came in reference to a blockchain for education credentialling concept that he passed along that I was critical of. As I just did a blog post recently on not just being a critic and instead being a person of action, well, here's why I was critical.\nI believe that it is my mission to be here, in this place, in this time, to try and strive towards zero cost education. The tools of production should be free and accessible to anyone and everyone. The content and media and materials produced should be fluid, working anywhere in any combination, being easy to find, easy to remix, easy to learn from anywhere. But, how then do people make money?\n\n\n\nZero cost? I mean really??\nYeah... probably; it is very difficult to legitimately hit zero on anything. But people don't pay for text editors anymore... do they (unless your a developer and you call it an IDE but even those are usually free). But SOMEONE makes it right? It comes from somewhere. Well, the person or organization that says \"hey, we can't do our job without a new way to edit text\" is the one ultimately paying for it. But if what they're selling isn't text editors it's code, then they can give away their editor without losing out on money.\nThe unique network effect of this is that you don't see a lot of a market for text editors ;). If people are going to up and give away something amazing for free (because it's what it provides them that generates revenue not the thing itself) then they can afford to do so, but it also depresses the potential for a market to exist. If people clean parks out of their own free-will then no one can make money providing services to clean parks. Whatever your example, there's plenty of examples of markets not being able to exist because \"there's no money there\". Yeah... but why? What conditions force a market to not be able to exist.\nThis is what I'm after, and have been for some time. How can we cause network effects to eliminate established markets? How can we accelerate the decline and collapse of corrupt markets. You could call that for-proits, you could call that greedy edtech, or bloated public institutions; whatever you call corrupt, how can we actively work to fix that? The release of all of the materials of production in establishment of educational experiences is my way of fixing that.\nIf the content is free. If the learning objects are free. If the material is remixable, adaptable, and easy to understand and translate. If the process of production is documented and the tools released. If everything in the creation and production, the knowledge, all of it, is released.... people will still want to get credentialed, validated and certified by institutions and gatekeepers of knowledge and outcomes. Students aren't paying you to produce a video about how to effectively treat minor wounds, they are paying for certification and verification that they know how to treat minor wounds as a result of the entire training. Putting that video on youtube and them saying \"Hey but I watched that\" isn't going to hold the same weight (ever) as an institution saying \"Yes, we verify that ______\n knows how to treat minor wounds, among other things\".\n\n\n\nThe story\nA child in poverty has access to a 3G based cellphone. They don't have access to quality medical advise (outside of that device), they don't have much in the way of clothing, shelter from the elements. A friend of theirs gets hurt; perhaps the only method of them knowing what to do to best help them is via that cell phone.\nThey search for resources on how to treat a wound and come up with how to do so on limited supplies. A how to, produced as part of basic medical training which was sponsored by a university for training grad students traveling to remote parts of Africa, demonstrates how to properly treat a wound when having access to limited resources. The child treats the wound, the friend is healed and the wound doesn't get infected.\nThe child, inspired by the devices ability to provide life altering advise, starts reading through the other materials provided. Maybe this inspires the child to be a lifelong learner, maybe it doesn't. But their friend may not be around if they didn't have free access to quality information able to be delivered at low bitrates in a reasonable amount of time.\nThat child, no matter how much you charge other then 0, will never be a customer. Them having access to it doesn't remove your ability to make money off of it as an organization. If anything, it creates the possibility for those without access to be lifted up, maybe even being able to dream of attending your university or another. Maybe they want to help and save others and decide the best way to do that is to become a certified or credentialed\n Dr. Now (as calious as it is) they are a customer.\nHow many 1000 other children can we save with quality information? How many would never be customers but could still grow, build and leverage the affordances of a Zer0 cost educational experience.

How can a tribe strengthen its ideals?\nHowever; critique alone is not enough when it comes to digital engagement. Is technology difficult? Sure, I guess it can be extremely off-putting to learn code when faced with the easy transition of human language =&gt;\n human critique. But code is how we can change the fabric of society if used effectively. You think Uber just screws with society without realizing it? Or Facebook? Or Google? Or anyone that uses more then just {}\n's to build \"products\". Often these \"products\" are vehicles of change if viewed correctly. Code allows us to manipulate the rules of the universe in this way. How humans engage, how we create, and how we interact with one another.\n\n\n\nEducation\nThis is especially important in education. Unlike other sectors, education often aligns what's possible based on what exists in order to teach topics it projects will be relevant to learners in the future. If an industry isn't going to exist in 5 years, we most likely (unless your a crony for-profit ;) ) teach topics that won't continue to exist or be areas of interest. (There are few areas of study around creating mechanical printing presses). So call it the millennial in me ('84) but I can't stand around and solely be a critic in our space without action. I see educators who critique practice, then implement different method in their own practice, share it with others and form communities of practice as a result. That's how it should be! If you are critiquing a space, you should be providing, through example, viable alternatives yes\n?\nBut when it comes to technology, the same exploration often boils down to \"I adopted my own content site\" or \"I just send my students to Google Sites\". It's about adoption of what exists in the world, not a critical analysis of what doesn't yet exist. For example; if a faculty member has access to an LMS (exists), and say video is difficult to upload (doesn't exist); the spoken solution might be \"we need a video solution that plugs into our LMS\". This is akin to sunk cost logic from the business realm. The reality might be though: \"I need a way of delivering lectures online and I have better things to do so just make this work so I can do my job\n\". In this regard, the video platform is not a solution but a Band-Aid that will be \"meh, good enough\" for the problem that actually exists (streamlining the entire lecture capture process end to end no matter where the deliver end-point).\n\n\n\nCritiquing critique\nIf we continue to simply critique this scenario without fundamentally changing it we'll never grow beyond the solutions and methods of teaching we have today both in residence and in online environments. If we don't actually build anything we'll never be any better than the market forces us to be! So if you're not a millennial, if you don't think education is just a market, and if you want to take more action then just selection of less terrible options in 2018... repeat after me:\n> I am a maker.\n>\n> I am creative.\n>\n> I am unique.\n>\n> I am important.\n>\n> Believing this makes me powerful.\n>\n> Belief alone is not enough.\n>\n> I know I need to take action.\n>\n> I know I can make a difference.\n>\n> I know I'm not alone in believing this.\n>\n> I know together we can fundamentally transform education.\n>\n> I know that by transforming education, we will change the world.\n>\n> You, just now\n\n\n\nAction\nTogether, I know there is nothing we can't build, nothing we can't solve, and no limit to our ability to not just critique the industry; but to change if for the better. Anyone only\n telling you the system is broken, or that others are wrong\n, yet offer no tangible solution\n, are not people to continue following blindly. Heed their words? Absolutely. Critique, even from legacy career titles is important as a foundation. Critical analysis makes us stronger after all.\nBut there comes a time when it's time for more than just words. And as a millennial, I not only demand action, I will take it. The future is so bright if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d all just agree to work together to build it. On this blog, and the other areas I work, you'll see nothing but projects seeking to build bridges to other communities of thought and code. Together, perhaps we all can turn the internet into an even greater platform for educational experiences.\nI hope to create, build, and grow that vision more with you in 2018 and beyond. Thank you.\n"},{"id":"item-897d5115-b6de-2c55-afa7-ba3262f4d9ca","title":"Pure Joy","location":"pure-joy","text":"The family gathered, friends came and we all shared a laugh.\nThen, he pulled me aside.

I like to post my ideas to my blog in addition to my submission so that I never lose them. This one is about the logical extension to HAX for desktop over 2018 which could be utilized to decentralize instructional experience creation. If this sounds of use to your institution, good, let's work together on it.\n\n\n\nProblem\nFaculty and staff have no idea what they can use at our institution. No matter how many registries of information or solutions we provide, people will need to practically be marketted to just to know they exist in the sea of information about what makes the university work. Beyond this, there is no way to provide continuous innovation to those not at high-touch units which work hand in hand with faculty to produce highly experimental course spaces and approaches. Even if we could find the things we need, very few of them talk to each other, their user experiences are all over the map, and most aren't very good for creating materials without needing to understand technical topics (like HTML). This isn't a PSU specific problem, Duke has an illustration that highlights 93+ solutions available to faculty, many of which don't talk even if they knew them all.\nHow to solve the problem of finding and once getting there creating engaging experiences?\n\n\n\nLeading questions\n\nWhat if faculty and staff involved in producing instructional experiences had an app that told them what services existed and made it instantly possible to use?\n\nWhat would it look like institutionally and what would the use experience look like?\n\nWhat needs would we have technically in order to support this?\n\n\n\n\n\nVision\nThis is the vision of HAX, a distributed instructional creation tool. HAX can be viewed as a public demo here\n. The important thing to keep in mind with this is that desktop publishing of applications can be done using HTML, making them far easier to build when you just make it work on the web. Imagine if users could log into the app on their laptop or phone and just create. Creating a new course? Start one on your local machine and with the press of a button publish it to Canvas, Drupal, ELMS:LN, GravCMS or a static website. Want to see what colleagues have shared from their courses? Fork their materials by searching an institution protected repository right from the app or connect to global shared object repositories. Instead of trying to market to faculty and staff what services are available, have people utilize a unified app which connects to the registry of everything available to them for teaching and learning.\nWant to stream video? Upload it to the app and it'll publish it to youtube or the video provider the university supports. Want to create H5P but don't understand hosting? Build it in the app and it'll save to the correct, FERPA valid location. Want to create a slideshow? Drag and drop a series of images which automatically get uploaded to Amazon S3 and then click a UI to \"build\" your slideshow. Worry about accessibility? HAX will take care of it for you automatically and without the ability to make in-accessible content. Content in HAX is accessible by default due to the game changing technology called webcomponents\n.\nLet's get faculty and staff out of the business of understanding HTML and instead build materials that allow them to leverage the services the institution provides without increased cognitive load.\n\n\n\n2018\nThe ELMS:LN team has begun work on such a desktop app called HAX deskop app\n which seeks to achieve this vision. Help us make this a reality in 2018 and beyond as we seek to empower faculty and align technology deployments with academic freedom and student curiosity.\n"},{"id":"item-1222b362-d24d-0aa7-20e7-724767f57656","title":"Using Webcomponents to unearth the NGDLE","location":"using-webcomponents-to-unearth-the-ngdle","text":"I find innovation best comes from the cross-sections. The weave between spaces tends to breed the best ideas of the two fabrics to create something new. It is this mentality that's caused me to look outside the island of edtech first, always asking \"What can I bring back to our space to make it better?\". 10 years ago, that was Drupal. I evangelized Drupal everywhere I could, wrote hundreds of modules, positively impacted tens of 1000s of sites in and out of education while making it possible for individual developers to leverage open source automation to do awesome things. Today I write to talk about the next thing I want to bring back to our island which I think is the\n technology to bring about an open ecosystem for the Next Generation Digital Learning Environment (NGDLE).\n\n\n\nWebcomponents explained\nThat technology, is webcomponents. Webcomponents, which you can find out more about on webcomponents.org\n is a four part browser standard that fundamentally changes what's possible in web based application development. The important thing to know is that webcomponents allows developers to define custom HTML elements and expresses how the browser handles them\n. So, bringing this back to education: We can use this technology standard in order to build pedagogically focused, valid, HTML tags\n\n.\n\n\n\nQuick note\nThis is a standard that all major browser vendors have committed to adopting and largely have, though polyfills are required to get full browser support. It also is leaving the IE6\/7\/8\/9\/10 world behind (the good news is, so has Microsoft\n).\n\n\n\nNGDLE backstory\nFor four years\n I've been building ELMS: Learning Network\n; trying to build a platform that can produce and sustain innovation in educational technology. For about that long, Educause has talked about the concept of NGDLE; what it might look like, what it might do, how to do it. Because it's a big concept to unpack, it's taken a few years to get people all on board with the idea and to agree that it's not an LMS (much like webcomponents was proposed in 2011 yet didn't become a real thing implemented until 2016). Because of the patterns of behaviors and methodology of ELMS:LN I currently consider it the only public NGDLE. For that reason, we're misunderstood but if NGDLE is Lego'ing \/ app-ifying the LMS; ELMS:LN wants to be the grid-plate. The fundamental base-plate to be plugged into. A routing system to stitch it all together and satisfy the need that no vendor will ever provide: a middleware to pull our ecosystems together.\n\n\n\nSo how do we all lego\nOk, so back to webcomponents. If we have a gridplate (you could provide your own, I'm not suggesting ELMS:LN be the only one) then we need lego bricks to plug into the board. But what fits that paradigm? Webcomponents allow you to take simple forms of HTML and build it up into increasingly complex elements. Let's look at a simple concept of a custom tag and how it would start to get towards pedagogically centric HTML.\nJust like HTML, custom tags can go into other custom tags. It can also use and retain semantic meaning just like HTML markup. So let's imagine that we had a semantic, custom element that provides the same thing as above. Now we have a tag called paper-button\n and every time I want to do above, I put that tag. Ok, now let's say I want a comment card. A comment card might be:\nWhich I can then use in something bigger and now I have a tag called comment-list\n or discussion-board\n. A discussion-board could be made out of any number of other smaller lego brick tags. Now I wire it up to a backend to save the data and I've got a fully functional HTML element that can be shared and remixed anywhere and so long as someone provides a backend to store it, it's going to work.\n\n\n\nCritical concepts that webcomponents provide to NGDLE if we do this right\n\nVisual consistency - right now when using multiple systems everyone decrys the cognitive load on students. webcomponents can provide a common visual design language and templated approach to help alleviate this. Everything will feel like it's the same (even if it's not)\n\nAccessibility - Because most accessibility mistakes happen when HTML is created, this allows us to make elements with high accessibility baked in, eliminating the ability for end-users to make that design element inaccessible.\n\nMaintainability - If we were to produce a tag such as lrn-assignment\n that expressed an assignment's properties visually, we can now swap out the guts of that tag and so long as the properties going into it are the same we don't need to update any existing content produced.\n\nInteroperability - By design, anything that imports the custom element (which is jsut an HTML file supplying the definition of what to do with that tag) will work. These will work in any system because it's the user's browser that's unpacking what it is and the specification itself gives the element definition and encapsulation.\n\nStandards based approach - by using a common methodology for front-end creation, we can standardize the UX and interaction patterns of our users and allow developers to all work together and utilize each other's lego bricks.\n\nSchema without Schema - We can start to wire up our custom elements to be schematized for indexing by search engines or our own advanced crawlers, ensuring there is additional semantic meaning to our content no matter where it lives. This has huge implications for OER\n for example.\n\nCommon Authoring - Because we just made this\n and it works anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnywhere?\nYeah, anywhere. HAX is another step towards my vision of NGDLE and the solutions we can craft when we work in this approach. An authoring experience that can pull data from anywhere and assemble it in a standards based format (HTML) which can be deployed anywhere. Imagine having identical authoring and instructional capabilities regardless of where an instructor is assembling a course. Open system? Do it in the open. Closed to the institution? Do it in the LMS. Training exercise or learning module on a random blog? Yeah, with an NGDLE based authoring approach, everything can be a mini-LMS and everything can feed other things to make new Learning experiences.\nIn the coming months through demonstration, documentation and seemingly impossible levels of progress (webcomponents + elmsln make application development trivial) I'll begin to show the path towards anyone building an NGDLE. What it provides users, How we are sharing things across institutions and systems, and how we can start to dissolve all learning systems into the NGDLE based worldview to provide better solutions for instructors and more engaging learning spaces online for learners.\n"},{"id":"item-be6f30a2-8a4d-e986-6af3-930f91e00464","title":"This is not reality","location":"this-is-not-reality","text":"\n\n\nChapter 1: The Shower\nA Developer takes a shower. A Developer closes his eyes, breathes deeply, and presses the water over his scalp and eyes and face. When hands press against the eye socket in the pressense of light, synapese fire off randomly. These random firings of \"light\" dance in the retina of the Developer seeking the answer to a problem. The retinas of the developer see the sparks trickel away as color fades back in.\nThe developer pauses.. then does it again, this time focusing on those whips of ocular static fizzle away. The whips form a pattern that looks like a central star that everything is firing out and away, creating their own central stars to fire out and away from. The occular misfires form a fractual image in the minds eye.\n\n\n\nChapter 2: The fractal\nThe developer talks through how a fractal could be used in the design of a system. The developer writes down the fractal. The developer sees a video the next day expressing, visually, the concept of divergent ideas spawning ohter divergent ideas, expressed as a series of hexagons firing off at a tangent and forming new hexagons. The developer recreates the pattern on a whiteboard and begins to theorize how this pattern could be used to represent systems.\n\n\n\nChapter 3: The monster within\nThe developer explains this to one other person over two hours. The manager is excited but leaves with: \"Who else would ever understand how any of this works though.\" The developer smiles, \"I guess I'll just have to build it to find out\". The developer works on prototypes, burning through hundreds of hours beyond what normal projects there are to pursue. The idea is like a dagger in his mind. He starts shutting down from the rest of the world and focusing solely on this one idea. This one fractal.\n\n\n\nChapter 4: The friend\nHe explains an early prototype to a friend. The friend is intrigued but doesn't get it or see how it's the fractal. The developer keeps pushing on, convinced there is a fractal there. The developer makes prototype after prototype, pouring through hours of tutorials and producing posts and videos looking for someone to understand what he's claiming to have discovered. No one gets it. Again, and again, over the next 2 years, the developer repeats this cycle, trying desperately to get someone to understand the picture in his mind now layed out as code and directory trees. Symlinks and .gitignores. But no one. Gets it.\n\n\n\nChapter 5: The group\nUntil... Someone does. Two people actually. And then from two, three, and three, four; and four, five; and five, a dozen, and dozens. Until the fractal no longer is some obscure concept it's the way of visualizing and attacking the problem. The Developer is no longer a developer, and no longer is a young developer either...\n\n\n\nChapter 6: The team\nThe Developer is part of a team. A Team hell bent on innovation. A Team that doesn't accept the world and the educational system the way it is but dreams of what it can be, what it will be. A Team that believes education is not a pidgenholed public service job but the place that fosters and grows innovations of it's own. A Team believes that noone is better then the sun of it's parts.\n\n\n\nChapter 7: The way forward\nA Team of Developers, instructors, instructional designers, designers, students, management; of mixed talents and backgrounds and abilities, form a new fractal pattern within a traditionally stasis laden system.\n\n\n\nChapter 8: The upside down\nThe Developer is no longer alone in the wilderness.

No. I'm behaving as if we're only half way there...and I always will.\nI love that clip from the video above; I'm always 10 years away from being my hero. Right now, one of my hero's is me at 40. Now, for context, that's 6.5 years away (oi i'm getting old). But it's true. I'm not focusing on today, I'm focusing on where I see us heading in the next 6.5 years as a community and thinking about how we get to that spot.\nRight now, ELMS as a project idea is 10 years old.

Society is marketing, image management, social studies, over produced vocals, and politicians that run on words like Hope and making things Great; yet still perpetuate the same levels of corruption as previous generations.\nWe stop going to churches that speak yet don't provide action or community (for refernece I have a church I love and it's because of action and community). We stop watching things that are heavily produced in favor of organic expression online (I'm a cord cutter). We stop paying attention to anything that we don't believe in (I'm not apathetic, I just know what I can\/'t influence and focus). We crave genuine discussion and see it avoided in much of the social sphere in favor of arguments from talking points memos fed to mouth pieces for\/against whatever the topic (this is why I'm often misidentified as both Liberal and Conservative because I follow logic and truth, not ideological purity).\nBe, Genuine. Gen Uine is what I'd much rather be known as then a Millennial or Gen Y or even Bryan Ollendyke or btopro. I don't care if you like me, but I never want you to doubt where I stand on a subject. That's Gen Uine; that's \"raw\" that's real that's what we desperately lack in society and need to embrace if we're ever to fix the problems we face.\nHow? Stop worrying about what other people think. Seek out facts, challenge bias. Speak up; for yourself and others. Don't follow the crowd and always question why a group feels the way it does and why you feel that way before joining a group.\n\n\n\nBe.\nGen Uine.\n\n\n"},{"id":"item-8099a4ba-8fbc-a60f-7451-ac12d8d17409","title":"Birthday party","location":"birthday-party","text":"A visual history of the last 10 years of my life working on what I believe will save education. What is saving education? Lower costs, increased access, increased accessibility, increased empathy in a population through more relatable technology platforms that connect humanity rather then divide. Improve educational outcomes and experiences, improve everything. Innovate with us.\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/elmsln\/status\/910870809216012288\n\n\n\n\nFaith\nIt's not here yet, but I wanted to write about the birthday of something very important in my life. An idea. An idea planted like a seed in my historical timeline to ever alter the course of my small history. That idea was originally called ELMS.\nBefore the network (ELMS: Learning Network), before 1 million + downloads of code produced by the project, 100s of reusable modules, the automated deployments of today and the architecture we have... there was a document, a white board, and a mission statement. In the basement of an dormatory at Penn State, I started my first and only career; building instructional technology.\nThe document in question was to put into writing the ideas we had on a whiteboard of the applications we needed to build. Nothing existed that did what we needed, and online education was still an infant. But in this basement, we drafted the statement that would unknowingly shape my future.\nThis is from the document with a timestamp of 09\/20\/2007\n:\n>ELMS stands for E-Learning Management System and is an open-source effort developed at Penn State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s e-Learning Institute. ELMS looks to make courses easier for staff to develop, deploy, and manage through a simple drag-and-drop method of content creation and organization. The overall goal of ELMS is to improve the student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience with e-learning courses by allowing educators to be more creative and flexible with the way their material is presented online\n. (emphasis added)\n\n\n\nFate\nIt would only make sense that I rediscovered this statement in 2017 shortly before the 10 year birthday of the idea of the project. This isn't the birthday of ELMS:LN (that's around 4 years old) but it's our history. In those days we were arguing to exist, to invest and build better options then existed at the time (which look childish by today). It was not about expansion, it was about survival.\nToday, in the expansion season of the project, we just scheduled interviews for a new hire with direct ties to the project. Another developer was hired recently a few streets over, interviews are being conducted for another who will contribute, and a 3rd party has hired a developer who has been active in contributions.\nOur interviews are set to take place, of all dates, 09\/20\/2017\n. If only that little whiteboard meeting and word doc could see where we were now. The types of projects we work on, the things we take for granted now, the pace at which we can roll out prototypes and bring ideas to fruition. The increasing gains in areas of UX and accessibility of our applications (plural now since those early days).\n\n\n\nFutures\nWhere we go from here, into the next 10 years of ELMS, as a learning network, I'll try to hold off on spilling. I know where we're going. I know the power of what we're building, the automation, the decentralized publishing models, the collapse of inefficencies, the deeper connections we can weave in humanity. We're going places far beyond just the notion of placing media on a screen and helping to manage it. We seek, eat, sleep, and breath transformation.\nThe two lead developers (me and @hey__mp), as well as those we direct, have completely overhauled and retooled our skillset in order to launch a new application in a bleeding edge framework (Polymer). Riding on top of an increasingly headless Drupal, we are pushing increasingly towards a highly polished, 1-page app style experience that's approachable and able to orcestrate the multi-domain monster.\nWhy is this important? I just said we. We retooled. I'm increasingly not the only voice in the destiny of our project...\nour.. project.\nYes, I quite like the sound of that. The direction for our future is being set by more and more people buying into the pattern, the vision, the idea I disrupted myself with.\nWe don't think we can influence and transform the education technology and outcomes of tomorrow: we know we can.\nHappy Birthday little tree; how beautiful your branches are becoming this season. And thank you for giving me purpose in my work.\n"},{"id":"item-773011dc-d235-36bf-7c70-fb0f8a4f4f1c","title":"[Alt] + {{reality}}","location":"alt-reality","text":"\nOur construction of reality is not the only one. This has always been the case, but I often fall victim to the assumption that because we now have access to more information that we will congeal to a singular perspective on subjects. The idea being that more diversity and access to greater world view of people will lead to better opinions.\nUnfortunately, this doesn't appear to be the case. Unlike the keystrokes at our disposal and terminal prompts ferrying away command sets with blazing speed and accuracy, the human psyche can't be simple commanded to change.\nWe can't grow up with a set of experiences, form an opinion on a subject, and then have it completely altered effectively in 140 characters. Yet social media and the internet of today, full of drying up \"news\" rooms and revenue models that favor catching eyeballs as opposed to expanding minds, leads us to dig in harder.\nIt leads me to two questions: Why do we feel the need to change someone's perspective? And more valuable, how best to go about doing so?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy\nLet's start with the easy one: Why? Why must we try and get others to think the way we do when their construction of reality is an alternative fact universe to our own. Part of the human condition is the drive for acceptance. Acceptance by those around us, our group, our circle, whatever you call it, we all want to \"fit-in\" even when fitting in means associating with the \"out\" crowd.\nSo knowing this, how could we possibly expect to get strangers on the internet to agree with our worldview when we have no concept of what their lives actually are? Why do we get consumed by social media and vitriolic arguments simply in the name of our truth being the one real truth (Now where have I heard this argument throughout history let me number the thousands of time periods...).\nThe Why, is the simplest answer and easier path to achieve to personal satisfaction. It is our primal instinct and hyper-me-centric technology based culture that promotes it. To improve as a society, we must improve as individuals and encourage others to improve as individuals as well. Not by telling why, but by leading others to arrive at our why. Only through honest questioning and engagement can we get others alt-reality to align with our own. When it isn't possible, it's also best to just accept that and move on. There's only a few billion other minds to try and align with anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow\nSo how best to generate the Why in others? The first step is back tracing how we arrived at our own conclusion. How did we become sensative, caring, accepting, loving, charitable, kind, compassionate, whatever the adjective is which is the behaviors we're wishing to exhibit in others. Was it learned through experiences (good or bad)? If so, perhaps it's better to tell a story to try and generate empathy rather then calling someone evil.\nHow is by far the harder option for engagement, both online and in real life. \"I'm depressed\" for example can be met with \"Why are you depressed?\", requiring a level of self-reflection probably not available to the asker (or comes across quazi-confrontational). However, \"How can I help you?\" is not accusitory or requiring self-reflection, it's walls are down and it's empathizing with the asker.\nI wonder how many we could reach with our world view if we treated everyone with an equal level of compassion, regardless of how \"evil\" their opinion might be. Taking the \"How did you come to think that way?\" rather than \"Why on earth would you ever think that!?\" or \"Why are you such a monster?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngage\n\nWhen was the last time you deescalated a situation when you were \"in the right\"? Did it end the conflict or did it burn you more to not win then it was worth?\n\n\n\n"},{"id":"item-1b6dd8f4-a01e-45d6-dafe-944b4c60320e","title":"End of Summer","location":"end-of-summer","text":"The sleepless nights, the early mornings, the last minute requests. It's the magical time of the year known as the end of summer. The time just after all the last minute work is put in to ensure things are ready to go for Fall in the semester. The time to finally take a moment, a quiet moment, and reflect on everything you've hoped to see.\nI saw my boys grow this summer, a lot, and I'm happy to have gotten to be there. I finally started to slow down. Not in the slacking way, but in the focusing energies on the things that I need to, when I need to. I stopped working or thinking about work for those precious moments when I got to see my son realize that the world is not the constraints of the city you grow up in.\nWhen we climbed rocks in the woods, and his face lighting up when I said \"Let's go climb that\".. \"That? We can climb that? We're allowed?!\"\nThe joy in his face, the thrill and \"danger\" of climbing some small boulders in the Poconos. The memories that I see my son making that were my memories, now, together we share them. It's a wonderful feeling, living in a shifted reality. Experiencing things from the perspective of my father years back, getting to see the pure joy and excitement in experiencing the little things.\nThe first roller coaster, the first water ride, the first experience revealed going some place new, and the fun associated with not knowing what's around the bend of the twisty carpet slide.

Stop living recklessly, alcohol or late nights working or otherwise. Stop doing anything that takes away from the small moments we get to share together when the devices go down and the emotions shine out.\n\n\n\nBreathe.\nIt's all gone quickly. Everything. The stresses will pass, and often aren't warrented anyway. Take a deep breathe and let reality seep in and the concerns of what may happen, might be happening or could happen dissolve away in the flow of deeper oxygen. These moments, each and every one are a gift. Embrace them, and you will flourish.\n\n\n\nSee.\nSee what's right before your eyes. See your family growing up, maturing, phases and seasons of life dancing before your eyes. See the amazing people you have in your life. Your family, friends, neighbors. See the world you're constructing for your children and know that one day, through pictures, they'll look back during their recognition of seasons and realize they want to give it to their children too.\n"},{"id":"item-bf9b2910-4880-c87f-4026-143bb334d1a6","title":"Combating the rise of authoritarianism","location":"combating-the-rise-of-authoritarianism","text":"You may have noticed the screwed up political season in the US. Where typical corrupt politicians suddenly look like amazingly attractive options when framed against mad-men, and mad-men trick the masses, only ingesting media in sound bytes, into openly abandoning their typical view points simply to support their team. To the general depression of the global population, the solutions projected by both of these \"major\" parties suggest that people from afar will solve all your problems.\nMagic\nIgnoring the obviousness that no one far away can instantly improve your own situation seems to be something the masses are embracing as if it is fact. Regardless of your feelings about what governments need to do, no one person can magically make things safe, put food on your table, etc. At least not in a timely manner. So why are people in open revolt of logic in favor of a strong-(wo)man to solve problems for them? A corrector, a protector, a demigod. Looking beyond notions of creator and general godlessness, giving rise to humans taking the place of gods in many American homes, we must ask; what are people in worship of?\nWorship\nThe American population as been worshiping stuff for a very long time. When presidents' declare the most patriotic thing to do is to go to the mall, regardless of the populous adherence, there is a problem. We worship stuff and things, and have for some time. Hyper consumerism and \"throw away\" culture have only accelerated with the advent of \"cheap\" personal computing and information systems. We now not only expect to have stuff, we expect that stuff to work faster, cheaper, be more portable, and always accessible to us.\nAddiction\nWorship of things has given way to technological addiction. It's become too easy to look at your phone or computer screen rather then the humans you are \"talking to\" in the room. As you interface more with humans through\u00c2\u00a0technology mediated methods, you expect and rely on your things to provide the deep human connection you are missing. All the while, you are missing out on what's going on around you. You've allowed engagement and control over your life to be trumped by the medium you are engaging with.\nControl\nWhy has this happened? People expecting things instantly from the global avatar-ization of humanity, I argue, has given rise to the demand for strong-(wo)men. We want someone to just go fix it, we want someone else to deal with it, because we're already delegating much of our human existence to our stuff in the form of information technology.\n\n When I tweet an emoji of a pizza to Domino's pizza, I have eliminated all human connections from the process and just expect, no\n\n, demand\n a pizza show up and that money leave my bank account (or debt) to accomplish this fact. I, as a consumer have been lead to believe that it is fundamentally better to not engage with humans (in this case for food) and instead rely on my things to bring me things.\nRe-humanizing through deployment\nHow can we bring harmony to this disharmonious social context? How did we reach the point that we expect, no, demand satisfaction and that someone else will just deal with it, without concern for others as humans (just as others). We must re-humanize society in all ways we can. Now, this is not to suggest that information technology is all the blame or that it can fix it (people were on trains decades ago staring at newspapers instead of talking to each other and the world got along just fine...ish). But, technology CAN be implemented in ways that encourage and foster human connections. I don't mean Face Time (this is still owned by Apple and you have no control over it or the data), I mean through redecentralization of overly centralized spaces.\nWait for green\nPeople like to try and align with the path presented before them. It's the normalcy bias. We see people walking a certain way, we want to walk a certain way. We're not all sheep, but there is an inherit human flaw that wants to go along to get along (for many people at some level). So when you see a red light, most people stop. Why? Because of \"the law\". Is the \"the law\" behind you, in front of you, over you at all times? No. But yet the social awareness of \"the rules\" drives us to want to do what's best for everyone (including us) and wait for green.\nWell what if we remade roads? What if we fundamentally transformed them; created on-ramps for our flying cars to launch off of and then eventually demolished the original roads and planted trees.\nRadical digital transformation\nWe can achieve this through structured (or rather largely unstructured) deployment of information technology. Through enough chain automation, we can effectively render modern technology unusable by comparison. If free, hyper-connected, hyper-flexible, liberty driven system deployment methodologies are used; could we not start to drive social change where people demand this level of flexibility in all things?\nPart of the dismay with the political system we find ourselves in today is that the internet makes everything too easy. Too instant. Too awesome and too many possibilities; it's blinding at some level. It's the radical transparency of binary data that's lead us to become disenfranchised with traditional forms of governance. Organizations are \"being disrupted\" aka collapsed through radical automation \/ usability \/ \"free technologies\" (ok so Uber, Hulu, etc, aren't free but relative to traditional models in these spaces they might as well be)\u00c2\u00a0all the time.\nLibertarian ideal driven technology\nWe need to create more hubs, more voices, more flexibility, more \"company-less\" spaces. And no, I don't mean an abandoning of capitalism; I mean the world needs to think more like email (protocol) and less like twitter (company, with apps that connect you to\u00c2\u00a0protocol). We need systems that operate more like living things if we want people to work, act, and behave more like humans and less like machines. By humanizing our technology deployments, we can deploy a better social fabric, and hopefully, together, in some small way, defeat the calls for\u00c2\u00a0authoritarian models and behaviors in favor of truly liberating ones.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\n"},{"id":"item-e479640f-e5e2-189a-1ae1-2a3f44d01a59","title":"Attacking the false Binary (of politics)","location":"attacking-the-false-binary-of-politics","text":"I sat, getting dressed in the locker room before pickup hockey. It's a local league with a mix of local people so it's as diverse as...well, the middle of no-where male dominated sports league\u00c2\u00a0can be. But what is absolutely diverse though is age and politics. The older guys will often razz each other with running conversations about politics, continuing discussions from Facebook, and (oddly) often times relatively rational (if you've been in a locker room, this is never to be expected).\nWhen someone (jokingly said) \"Hilary is so terrible I'd almost vote for Drumpf...{razzing}\u00c2\u00a0I SAID ALMOST\" I stopped and gained insight into the flawed logic of much of American politics (#thanksmedia). To this discussion I said \"vomit\" (the group is aware I'm pretty outspoken politically). Someone then said \"Well what if it was reversed\" and I said \"Double-vomit\". Some people laughed and said they'd write in Mickey mouse, etc.\nIt's a Binary decision\nThen the phrase came up \"Well, it's a binary decision\" and for the first time in a long time... I kept a conversation going about politics when I'd honestly rather just go play hockey. \"No. it's not, or if it is it's Binary between 2 terrible options and 1 option that isn't that\" (Eloquent I know). This was met with other small laughs and a few discussing that they can't vote 3rd party because they've done that before and nothing happens. The heard mentality, the need to vote one way the media tells you to or the other, is exactly why we are in the current mess we are.\nThere are no good options\nThis simply isn't true. As I've written about previously in the unity of thought that exists between Tea Party and Occupy\u00c2\u00a0Wall street people, the two party system perpetuated by media and advertising dollars is the problem and a reality TV \"star\" parading under the banner of one of those (while being blatantly racist to play upon people's fears) is not going to solve anything.\nTo my Conservative friends\nTo my Conservative friends,\u00c2\u00a0there is a far better option and you are being played by the same media that your false choice is the only choice (at the same time decrying how corrupt \/ worthless the media is). You are being played by a media and political class that insist you either are for (the evil) Hilary (HHHHEERRRRRR\n\n) or not. You claim to believe in small government (HA), being socially conservative (HA), open minded, having the moral high ground, better on the economy, better on tax policy, better on local control; and yet you will claim that\u00c2\u00a0this\n\n\u00c2\u00a0is your best option. \"Sad\".\nTo my Socialist friends.\nYou \"believe\" in what you claim to believe on the basis of social justice, criminal justice reform, the need for fairness, anti-corruption and getting wall street out of the business of the people. You march in the streets, you demand change, and yet somehow here you are even after \"change\" sweeps into power, still here, on the streets, powerless and more divided and broken then before. Almost 50% of you latched onto someone who said you could get free stuff in this country if we just changed everything, if we just taxed more, if we just had Wallstreet less, etc. And yet you lay down your principles that you \"fought\" for and spoke out about for months to support someone who is clearly above the law and funded heavily by the same people you claim to need to get out of politics.\nAddiction\nI love you, I care about you both (all of you actually) and I wish you could get out of your own way. I wish you could embrace each other and see the goodness in each but sadly, you are too busy worrying about \"winning\" (which isn't a thing, this isn't a sports league, there is no concept of win eternally nor in your life time, there's always\u00c2\u00a0more\n\n). But you both are arguing with each other instead of realizing that you can unite against a common enemy: Corruption, Greed, authoritarianism.\nAnother way out\nThere is another way out, which has a foothold in American politics, which is socially minded, which is fiscally minded, which is on the ballot in all 50 states, which has a base to its movement and a message. It's too small (relatively speaking) to be backed in the same way by the same corrupt institutions that have brought us to this point. It is largely ignored by the media because it doesn't see the same click throughs as the corrupt two parties we see today. I'm speaking of course about\u00c2\u00a0Libertarianism and the Libertarian party.\nHistorically I am a libertarian leaning conservative, but seeing what conservatives supposedly support and stand for, I increasingly identify as only Libertarian. It is the way out. What policies do they represent? Minimal government involvement in the lives of people. They are counter to the establishment of each political party because they voice that the government and structure of government is the problem. Not that we need no government, that we need an emphasis on people and individual\u00c2\u00a0liberty. Live and let live.\nGoogle it\nWhat policies specifically? You can use Google, I don't need to spell that out for you. But when someone asked me about such a question I answered with \"does it really matter? You currently have the same authoritarian 1 or authoritarian 2 option.\" Some binary decision that is.\nLook, search, seek out information, especially beyond what you are comfortable with. In the age of the digital revolution, it's insane that we only have two options to set the course for society.\u00c2\u00a0To all\u00c2\u00a0options though, regardless of who that is;\u00c2\u00a0instead of asking do I agree with these policies, ask yourself who will make\u00c2\u00a0you more free? What points in the direction of the internet, more free, more choice, more speech, more options, more ideas? Then you'll have your answer of who to vote for, rather then simply who to vote against. We deserve better then this, make it so.\n"},{"id":"item-92c8d1d5-e579-930b-2c57-e9753e9dfefe","title":"Singularity, Digital Activism, and saving our institutions","location":"singularity-digital-activism-and-saving-our-institutions","text":"*This talk was originally posted on elmsln.org.

Everyone can become their own nation state because of the authority that technology affords us. If broadcasting and viewership is validation, we all have been validated as having the ability to enact and broadcast change.\nYou may have heard of DDoS in tech news. A DDoS is a Distributed Denial of Service. Basically a whole bunch of hackers (or if you're really smart, just one infecting many systems) perpetrates a DDoS by slamming certain systems with traffic. This has other names like orbital ion cannon, ping of death and \"wiping a site from the internet\". Basically you keep shelling a system from so many points of entry that firewalls can't identify\u00c2\u00a0the traffic as the same request so it makes the servers\u00c2\u00a0think that there's just a lot of people accessing.\nToday I'd like to propose a human based form of the same idea which we will dub a DDoSA -\u00c2\u00a0Distributed Denial of System Authority. Utilizing this technique individuals, much like a DDoS, can overwhelm a system of control with too many requests, rendering the controlling authority useless. There's too many \"packets\" for the organization to control which disrupts the organization's ability to effectively control the message, solutions, methods of practice, etc.\nLet me explain with a bad example...\nYou are disgusted that people use Sharepoint to share documents. You suggest using DropBox but that's shut down as an individual because of security, policy, xyz. In order to correctly utilize DropBox, you don't need to go to anyone asking for permissions, you need to tell your friends to use DropBox. And then, when collaboration is through the roof and productivity is way up, you have your friends tell their friends. Soon, the entire organization is utilizing the non-standard tool\u00c2\u00a0in a peer-to-peer, occupy wall street fashion.\nSo does it matter if DropBox is the christened solution of the organization? No, everyone just uses it. (This is unofficial Slack channels at most companies in a nutshell) People self-organize around what works best when friction to do so is limited (internet \/ free technologies).\nI often voice the opinion that policy is irrelevant in the face of automation; because, it is impossible to enforce that which automation can alleviate so easily. Make automation invisible (Slack) and highly usable (Slack) and you'll see citizen agents\u00c2\u00a0pop up all over the place.\nThe person that implemented Sharepoint and told others to use it has no ability to keep pace with those rapidly utilizing and encouraging others to utilize DropBox. The capabilities are far greater then SharePoint. Maybe they have greater control over their files. What ever the case, the citizen agents are a more effective marketing tool then the lone individual from on high bringing a solution into the organization.\nDDoSA in RL\nDDoSAs have other names in real life. Sit ins. Arab Spring. Occupy Movement. Flooding prisons til they are over capacity with conscientious objectors. These are all the same, just applying the tactic to different mediums. Take quantity X that has stopgap X-1. Apply X against stopgap X-1. Watch stopgap X-1 become overwhelmed because X is always greater. Far more important then authority in pulling off a DDoSA is social capital\n. Social capital, while not as quantifiable as money, is a much deeper well to draw from once filled.\nIt takes a lot longer to fill that well then making money, building social capital involves P2P connections and those take time to build\u00c2\u00a0(Occupy was months when at its height). But it is far more powerful then money as we move increasingly towards a block-chain-esk society (and, we are). I mean, several countries collapsed in part because of the power of the individuals that stopped believing in the authority of their governing structures.\nDDoSA to reclaim control\nThe air about a situation in which you might see a DDoSA usually stems from a lack of control. Feelings of disempowerment drive some to apathy and others to organize. People strive make meaning of and be in control of the world around them. And so as our technologies get cheaper, easier, and faster they'll increasingly demand more order be established to help them pick through the chaos all around.\nTo use a DDoSA in your organization currently plagued by Slack (I love slack, it's a\u00c2\u00a0straw-man) to get them to own the solution via something like MatterMost\n; you need to do the leg work and setup an instance. Then you need to get it integrated into your life and ensure it's easy to use, be the best first review that you can be for the new replacement technology. Then, you need to start getting people signed up on the mattermost instance by proxy. Friends, colleagues, to share a file, to go \"hey have you seen...\". Little by little, in dribs and drabs, you'll start tapping into that well of social capital in order to get your organization to stop standardizing on Slack and move over to MatterMost.\nWhat did people gain? Well, they still use a communication tool but maybe in this instance the surface \u00c2\u00a0gain is in no longer paying Slack for a hosted instance. The social effects of this change could be far greater. Maybe without a paywall more people in the company can use the software. Maybe there's custom integration you can now write \/ pay for as a result of owning the technology.

Before you spew hate, recall this.\nI am an observer of politics that tries to \"play the game\" a bit differently.

As a result, I follow many people on both \"sides\" of many issues.\u00c2\u00a0I follow people of many\u00c2\u00a0parties, view points, and affiliations in order to better understand (140 characters at a time mind you) how they try to draw support for their truth being more correct then others. In doing this, I've identified a common thread that should form the 3rd major political party, but hasn't (yet) because the other two require us all to be divided (it sells better on the news).\nLet's abstract potentially negative messaging and viewpoints; what common threads exist\u00c2\u00a0between the two \"extremist\"\u00c2\u00a0(media deemed, not my own)\u00c2\u00a0political movements that make up both \"major\" political parties?\u00c2\u00a0Because if we study and understand the concerns of the \"extremists\" maybe we can figure out how to form a new camp that encompasses both.\nTwo candidates right now are offshoots of grassroots activism the last decade.\nOccupy\nBernie Sanders probably immediately comes to mind if you follow or believe in this political movement. It's largely (but not exclusively) thought of as:\nBanks are corrupt\nTax policy isn't tipped in the favor of the little guy\nThe system is rigged so the rich keep getting richer\nMinorities are especially excluded and abused by this system of control\nWe are in endless wars we have no business being in\nPolitics needs reform to prevent corruption\n\nIn this world view, Banks and The Rich are largely thought of as the source of corruption so we need government to be brought back into control of the people in order to eliminate the corruption.\nTea\nThere are several Republican figures that come to mind when the Tea Party is evoked but based on the principles of less government involvement, lower taxes and anti-corruption I'd have to say Ted Cruz is the spokesperson. Bullet points here:\nGovernment is too big and corrupt (as a result)\nTaxes are too high (as a result of too big bureaucracy)\nThe system is rigged, political elites keep getting richer\nEveryone is abused by this system\nPolitics needs reform to prevent corruption\nIn this world view, Government and hierarchies are largely to blame, not them in and of themselves, but because of the types of people that find their way into these hierarchies. For example, a complex tax code leads to it being written in a way to benefit some and not others.\n\nI largely ignore social issues in analysis and selection on candidates. It's weird to say but I've seen that social change is enacted from pressures from society as a whole. As a result, the rising up of people that are passionate about change is how to enact social change.\nThis is 2016\nWith the internet, with technology, with all our capabilities to spread positivity, crowd fund and disseminate information; how are we still here? A two party system with media coverage and collusion that leads us to largely all unhappy. We're allowing our media and social media to keep us apart. What can we agree on even in these two extreme propositions of Occupy and Tea Party movements.\nCorruption is king\nHow can we reduce corruption? Both sides identify this but then have different views on Taxes (we aren't doing enough vs we're doing too much). This will be my tell as a classic liberal, but we need less of a system in order to have less corruption. This doesn't mean we don't need a system but we do need a less complex system (taxes and in general); and here's why.\nIf you are a developer you may have heard of \"legacy code\" and the need to refactor code. Unlike other resources, having more code does not equate to having more effective code. Well friends, we're running on legacy code that is in desperate need of refactorring. We've got a great operating system, but we've been adding way too much functionality and it's bringing the whole thing down. We don't need to throw away everything we've ever done, but we do need to take those concepts and completely rewrite them for the modern era.\nYes, Government needs it's Drupal 8 moment. Is the end product \"the same\"? In some ways yes. We still make a CMS, it still makes great websites and it's still responsive. But we're rooting out all the bloat that's weighing our awesome product down. We're doing things smarter, not always differently.\nCorruption and governmental refactoring\u00c2\u00a0needs to be the focus of a unified movement between Occupy and Tea people. Quit arguing over social policy, quit arguing your party or person vs their party or person. Look beyond parties, look at what we're doing to our country and unite to pull us back from the edge (where edge is Fascism, rioting because of corruption, further deepening of racial divides). Quit pointing the finger and start reaching out with love. Lay down your ideologies and realize this: We are all not that different, we all want the corruption to end. Seek out those that have this message. One says we can have less corruption through regulation while the other proposes solutions that involve tearing down parts of the institution to reduce corruption though there being less of it.\nPersonally, I'm for the refactor (because where are these more perfect Angels) but align on anti-corruption and we will solve our problems.\n"},{"id":"item-9566b53a-7c4c-54fb-4054-390d7c4c6e2e","title":"Efficiency as Activism","location":"efficiency-as-activism","text":"Efficiency is not just the right thing to do or the act of making things better then before.

It's why what we're doing doesn't seem believable, because I've been working on the scaffolding of what it is we're standing on today, 3 years ago. I intentionally, painfully so at times, focused on under the hood automation rather then front-facing usability. Because you can always make people like the way something looks, you can never change what it's built on top of (or at least not easily).\nAnd so, when I say we can pick up and give you every innovation our group has made and let you produce new ones; and do so with exponentially increasing accuracy, capability, ease of use and ease of setup.

This implies control structures which could align with the human hierarchy, a thing we've placed in legacy\n\n\n.\nIn order to subvert existing human hierarchies, we need technology that doesn't operate like humans do..well, not in their whole being. We need to look to\u00c2\u00a0organic chemistry. A virus, an infection, something that can replicate itself and spread. Less the negative connotations of disease and more the biological process of cell replication.\u00c2\u00a0Yes, we'll still have to have central listings of some form. The internet has DNS, indicating where the distributed some\u00c2\u00a0things are located (as does TOR). So we'll need\u00c2\u00a0repositories of some kind in order to ensure the authenticity of the package (GitHub, rpm's and what not) but by intentionally creating an organic deployment methodology, we can avoid the emergence of\u00c2\u00a0control\n\n\n.\nNow it's not that order is a bad thing. Surely order has given rise to the great (and fading) civilizations that we find ourselves in today (whatever the day is, we'll make new ones if these constructs fail us). But nature can break through and change society where code wrapped in business logic cannot. We need to liberate and decentralize; so less twitter (distributed as it may be, it is the only broker of tweets) and more email (truly distributed throughout the world and without ownership on the standard).\n\u00c2\u00a0\nTraditional Deployments (modern day)\n\nProducts live in containers next to each other without knowledge of whos who.\n\n\n\n\nModern deployments use docker\n\n\n or some form of virtualization\n\n\n. They effectively take the ins and outs of an application, tokenize them, and then slap them up in \"the cloud\" (AWS... all of them). Once there, when you buy into a product, they basically are just making you a containerized instance on AWS and charging you overhead. SaaS works because you are lazy (we all are) and we like having the simplicity of someone else taking out our garbage rather then us having to haul it to the dump every week.\nUnfortunately, this puts us in the passenger seat to innovation\n\n\n. By giving up the routine of the garbage, we're beholden to the collection and disposal patterns of the garbage\u00c2\u00a0men. We don't need to worry ourselves with innovation, they'll ensure trash A gets to dump site B, now turn off your brain and start printing money on your existing workflows.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nGrabbing control\nBy taking control, we are taking on risk (in the short-term) in order to gain creative direction in the future. Perhaps we no longer want to shill garbage, perhaps we want to recycle methane off-gasing of shallowly dug dump sites while utilizing solar powered vehicles. We now have that level of creative control. But unlike this fictitious scenario, we don't have to worry ourselves with the mechanisms involved; it's technology, and containerized technology at that; We can do (and scale) anything.\nContainerizing, and for this definition I'm using I mean using separate hardware per client\n\n\n, is the way to increase innovation as well as reduce risk. We can keep existing systems in place with existing client bases while driving forward with new, innovative clients that have unique needs, without worry of corrupting the successes of yesteryear.\nBut what if we wanted to take containerization a step further. What if we containerized different aspects of existing clients, enabling us to innovate more rapidly even in existing client bases. But this must come at the expense of complexity and risk, right? Not if we start designing our deployments and products like living things\n\n\n.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nDeploying an organic compound\n\nAgency of websites\n\n\n\n\nWe need to start thinking of our applications and their deployment as living things. We aren't just creating something people see on the web, we're creating engagement, uniting people across barriers and putting them in front of the information they need to live better lives. These experiences with a technology produce, in effect, agency\n\n\n.\nWhile this is not an autonomous, living, thinking organism, it is the first step towards the evolution of more complex beings. Mapping the internet to evolutionary processes, we are describing at single celled organisms. They can't do much on their own, but they are alive and mostly just react to the stimuli they are prodded with in the world.\nWhen we enter input, we get reaction, etc.\nThe fun thing about living systems though and thinking about their design as such is that single celled organisms don't remain that way for long. Interestingly though, as we move up through biology, complex structures are often formed of simpler patterns repeated thousands of times.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nOrganically pattern deployments\nAn organically pattern deployment\n\n\n is a system that has the capability to set it self up again. I'm not talking traditional\u00c2\u00a0\n\nSimple forms complex structures\n\n\n\n\ncontainerization where there's a host of some kind that's doing the replication. I mean, a system that is able to set itself up, and then setup replicants\u00c2\u00a0of itself which are fully functioning duplicates. A deployment methodology that patterns itself more off nature\u00c2\u00a0then our legacy human hierarchies.\nCell division\n\n\n is the biological phase when a cell grows or splits off. It is a functional replica after the initial cell structure has reached an apex through the consumption of resources. With plants;\u00c2\u00a0sunlight, water, minerals. In the case of system deployments this could be usage, users, and data.\nAfter enough usage, users, and data have been accumulated in a single system, the system follows the natural biological process (because we are creating life) by which its time to grow. This could mean more servers, more RAM, more processors, more storage, etc. In the case of a deployment methodology though, this means that the system will imprint itself upon a new server.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nReplication\n\nCreating Life\n\n\n\n\nThe git repo is instructions built in that suggest how to setup a new copy of itself. Once the new copy of itself has been established, the new cell can call home to the old and ask for additional instructions. This is where we start to mirror nature in creating complexity from organized simplicity. The new cell (Cell B) is told that it was created because we need to migrate aspects of Cell A were becoming overburdened. Maybe there's too many people using function X which can be split off into a dedicated function for Cell B. Cell A then transfers everything needed to accomplish function X onto Cell B.\nBecause it's nature and we're talking about small, replicated tasks over time, it is important to note that in the evolutionary process, Cell B could handle all the tasks of Cell A\n\n\n (technically). The point of the Division is to create a new, more complex organism that's able to delegate functions of the being more effectively. As Cell A and B expand in capabilities,\u00c2\u00a0users, data and overall usage; the process could be repeated, forming a new organism that's made up of the simpler parts.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nMy work\nThis is the direction we're taking ELMS learning network, the educational technology platform that I help drive. The system will be treated like a living thing. Through the replication of simple tasks (a system that sets itself up) and the instructions to set itself up again (its DNA)\u00c2\u00a0included in the repo, we can start to form fractal deployments of ELMSLN. A fractal deployment could be a copy of ELMSLN that is actually several working together to form one cohesive suite of systems\n\n\n. Let's say there are 13\u00c2\u00a0systems in ELMSLN that are discrete functionality that use RESTful web-services to talk to each other. Then these could live on 13\u00c2\u00a0different servers since they are served from 13\u00c2\u00a0different domains already.\nThe organic fractal component to the ELMSLN architecture would then suggest that 13\u00c2\u00a0different copies of ELMSLN could be stitched together seamlessly to act as one system to its user-base. These systems would be stood up as Cell Division from the original deployment. Using SSH keys and having access to automated DNS reconfiguration we could have the Cell A deployment actually set the rest of the network up automatically. It could, in effect, mutate from a single celled organism into a more complex one. And because it knows how it set itself up, and the rest of itself knows how it set itself up (meta), we could put in place security procedures and mechanisms that have the network act proactively. We could start to program the single celled organism to perform increasingly more autonomous tasks, which then propagate to the rest of the parts of the organism to produce exponentially more autonomy.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nAt that point, we're no longer just\n\n\n creating software, we're creating life\n\n\n.\n"},{"id":"item-b1e5eaa3-a5e9-ee65-d607-9d5cf65f5e70","title":"Legacy of Human Hierarchy","location":"legacy-of-human-hierarchy","text":"\nThe hierarchy of humanity is changing.\nSorry, let me rephrase..

The future of SaaS based products is increasingly automated (so stop paying someone to do what you can automate yourself if you plan to exist 50 years from now).\nThe legacy of human infrastructure\nBut we've already hired hundreds of people. But we've already got people managing them in a pyramid shaped structure. Oh, so you think you're the only one? No, everyone still organizes this way in the old world constructed before the dawn of deployment architecture. Instead of giving up though, how can we reenvision ourselves and our organizations to remain competitive (aka exist) the next 10 year transition.\nBig Red Button\nIf your organization had a Big Red Button (that was easy) of sorts that did all the work for you, who would you allow to push it? Can everyone push the button if it produced new ideas, new products, better outcomes? Or is the HPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion) the only one that matters, the only idea allowed to be pushed into production. When we've dissolved the legacy infrastructure of humanity we'll be able to allow anyone with any idea to empower the organization to win.

Dissolve these immediately, people will be happier.\nVacated positions\n - Force the structures underneath these positions to reorganize, flatten, and allow that transformation to allow business processes to evolve.\n\nEvolve\nBusiness practices\n - Workflows in the human hierarchy were built around who knew what and could accomplish a task. The future deployment hierarchy empowers all members to push the big red button of change.\nTrust\n - If you can't trust someone to push the big red button of progress, they shouldn't be on the team. Opening up room for failure ensures we aren't denied success in the process.

Why was the individual so transformative when all the structures of the day were not? Why is it that innovation lives in the garage but not in the boardroom?\nInnovation is born of chaos and random chance... seemingly. It is a spark of imagination from the individual. The euphoria of bringing a new idea to life. In the unknown; that which we\u00c2\u00a0DIG\n\u00c2\u00a0up and bring to life. And so, it is not simply enough to create a product that contains the innovations and ideas of the individuals that produced them.

If we are to truely build a better society, we must seek to collapse structures, not simply build different ones that drive towards the same financial end.\nAnd so here we work, building an army of innovators by breaking the chains of technology that keep ideas from reality and stamped out in boardrooms and support forums. Welcome to the revolution, where authors give away their views on technology and its ability to transform society. We are here to change the notion\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0control\n\u00c2\u00a0by empowering everyone to be in\u00c2\u00a0control\n\u00c2\u00a0of their own destiny.\n"},{"id":"item-25e65b02-61b2-b987-7e86-601a241f74c9","title":"Transforming industry through information altruism","location":"transforming-industry-through-information-altruism","text":"\nThis posting is a refinement of a concept that I presented earlier: Using OSS to disrupt industries.\n\nThrough the title, I am suggesting that there are negative network-effects in the form of social impact with open source systems. \u00c2\u00a0In fact, I'll go so far to say that open source software can be used to collapse entire markets, both IT and non-IT. \u00c2\u00a0Much like having access to capital allows you to invest in ventures that often times generate more capital (once rich it's easier to become super-rich), the more available source code is, the easier it is to free-up more and more source code.\nIt also can cause closed-source projects to collapse (or at least their market to reduce) as more and more adopt open practices. \u00c2\u00a0An unfortunate fact though is that information walling often results in more jobs. \u00c2\u00a0The more hops information has to take, the more jobs were created to get there. \u00c2\u00a0How many people got put out of jobs because automation happened in the phone switch industry? \u00c2\u00a0I believe the same thing will soon be happening to those in the open source industry as the industry turns inward and puts itself out of work. \u00c2\u00a0First it'll be some projects taking each other out of the next few years thanks to market forces but at least in the Drupal community, I'm already seeing cracks.\nPeople at the top asking for more and more control over the platform, even though it's the very thing that they went to open source to get away from. \u00c2\u00a0Here are some other examples I could come up with of where giving away code has far greater consequences then just giving code away.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nDigital altruism collapsing digital form\nOpen source is an iterative process which leads to the open sourcing of more technologies that enable more people to do more with less technical knowledge. \u00c2\u00a0Apache leads to PHP \/ MySQL leads to Wordpress \/ Drupal systems. \u00c2\u00a0As a result, I've seen Dreamweaver (as an example) go from a tool that I used to build websites to a tool that I use to build code to allow others to build websites. \u00c2\u00a0This is the creative and destructive power of open source.\nDigital altruism collapsing digital form and physical form\nThis doesn't have to just be contained to software platforms though. \u00c2\u00a0Wikipedia, leads to freer access to information, leads to marginalization of paid information sources (books, Encarta, etc) which collapses the previous\u00c2\u00a0silo-ing of knowledge in sources that had a cost of entry.\nDigital Altruism collapsing the IT industry\nPrevious web-development shops had coders, site layout and design, producers, copy editors, graphic artists, server manager, all with different talents and skills. \u00c2\u00a0Now with the web landscape being as it is, the cost of entry has been lowered for\u00c2\u00a0everyone. \u00c2\u00a0As such, I don't need to know layout \/ design because of captured, open knowledge, in the form themes \/ templates. \u00c2\u00a0I don't need copy editors (or as many) because everyone can self-moderate content as well as use small publishing workflows to release content. \u00c2\u00a0Server management consoles exist and captured knowledge in the form of things like MAMP and XAMPP (not to mention open source based services like wordpress.com) make it easy to get a site up and off the ground. \u00c2\u00a0Come to think of it, I don't even need me, the coder, because other coders have captured install and configuration knowledge in the CMS like wordpress.com.\nNo, the only person \"needed\" to produce a high quality website with new content is the content author and maybe a manager (though those could be the same person).\nWhat's the trend I'm seeing currently? \u00c2\u00a0We're going from a world where there are less hubs and less authorities. \u00c2\u00a0Where information can be created and disseminated so quickly that newspapers and traditional TV media aren't going away entirely, but are definitely being softened in tone. \u00c2\u00a0If I want an opinion I can go anywhere and get it and that's great (most people already know this).\nBut what I also see happening, is that we're collapsing our own industry. \u00c2\u00a0I see less and less people wanting to get into the IT sector because those that have come before them have made things so easy, so wyziwig'ed, so fast that it's not interesting to them. \u00c2\u00a0This will lead to less ideas, less choice, and only a few technical authorities who can effectively kick the door shut on all those who come after them. \u00c2\u00a0A truly, Apple (and a few others) world of elite companies as well as a few elite open source advocates along for the ride.\nConnect the dots, speak out for more choice, question why someone is giving you something for free ;).\n"},{"id":"item-c6866e7a-1981-8c76-293a-0b96181e4945","title":"Sustainable Systems Development: A moral issue","location":"sustainable-systems-development-a-moral-issue","text":"\nSustainability has been a \"hot\" topic for the last five plus years now. It is often talked about in the context of the environmentalist movement or farming, but allow me to give the concept a bit of a technical and moral spin. Sustainability is all about planning for the future of humanity. What our children and the world's children will experience as a result of our actions today.\nDo you think your house will be standing 100 years from now? How about 1000s, like the pantheon? No? Me neither. This is the issue I've come to with systems design. I came into a world where people did things with a lack of planning for the future directions it would take us. I didn't create the issues, but it is all of our responsibility to fix it.\nHow many systems have you used that needed to be explained to you far beyond 5 minutes? How many wasteful positions do you see that maintain a single, custom system? How many\u00c2\u00a0additional\u00c2\u00a0positions do you see as a result of poor, bloated work-flows? How many people know how to do your job?\nThis all brings me to the issue of morality in systems design \/ implementation. Systems should be designed in such a way that they are not only easy to use but easy to maintain and sustain for decades, not months and years.\u00c2\u00a0 Breaking down the walls between those creating the system and those in need of a system isn't just a best practice, it's a moral prerogative.\nThe technical elites (haves) have a moral obligation to design and develop systems in such a way that everyone (even have nots) can use them.\u00c2\u00a0Experience design (UX) is not just a \"nice to have\" requirement, it is a moral issue.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a0It is immoral to design something that allows the system to be dependent upon your knowledge (or any small group of people) to continue running.\nYeah, believe me, it's very tempting to hand a system off to a client who has no clue what they're doing and intentionally design it so you'll always have to be involved.\nbig money big money no Wammies...\u00c2\u00a0STOP.\nIt's also far more difficult to design in such a way that you don't have to be involved (even as much) in the future.\u00c2\u00a0 Let's face it, that's less money for you and probably more work to get a product out to the client.\nThere has been a bit of a code of ethics push in the Drupal community which has had me thinking about all this so I'd like to make one of my own.\u00c2\u00a0 These are some of the principles that I strive towards in everything I write and in every interaction with those in the community:\nIt is immoral to design something that only you understand how it works\n\n\n\nSystems must be designed with user-groups in mind (UX)\n\n\n\nEvery line of code\u00c2\u00a0should seek to empower people to never have to know it exists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions must be simple, elegant and understandable by the those tasked with managing the system after it is deployed.\n\n\n\nTalk early, and talk often. The more transparent you are in your design, development, and delivery processes the easier it would be for someone else to pick up your work and run with it\n\n\n\nBe passionate in the code you write; if you're not into it, move on\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can write code to do lots of good and bad things; Don't take a job where you don't agree with the result\n\n\n\nFeedback, positive or negative is feedback and should be responded to in the same way\n\n\n\nLeverage developed code as much as you can so that glue \/ custom modules are as small as possible\n\n\n\nRealize that your never done (and be satisfied with it), you're simply advancing the ball a little further down the field every day, month, year, generation\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]
